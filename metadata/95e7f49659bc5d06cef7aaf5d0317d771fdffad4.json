The roots of the West's superior intellectual and artistic creativity should be traced back to the aristocratic warlike culture of Indo-European speakers. Among the many fascinating topics discussed are: the ascendancy of multicultural historians and the degradation of European history; China's ecological endowments and imperial windfalls; military revolutions in Europe 1300-1800; the science and chivalry of Henry the Navigator; Judaism and its contribution to Western rationalism; the cultural richness of Max Weber versus the intellectual poverty of Pomeranz, Wong, Goldstone, Goody, and A.G. Frank; change without progress in the East; Hegel's Phenomenology of the [Western] Spirit; Nietzsche and the education of the Homeric Greeks; Kojeve's master-slave dialectic and the Western state of nature; Christian virtues and German aristocratic expansionism.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 528 pages\n# Publisher: Brill (February 7, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 9004192484\n# ISBN-13: 978-9004192485","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95e7f49659bc5d06cef7aaf5d0317d771fdffad4","amp;dn":"The+Uniqueness+of+Western+Civilization+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95e7f49659bc5d06cef7aaf5d0317d771fdffad4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,231,244,150,89,188,93,6,206,247,170,245,208,49,125,119,31,223,250,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
