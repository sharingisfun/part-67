At the end of Three's Company Jack Tripper met Vicky Bradford and fell in love. Three's a Crowd begins with them moving into the apartment above Jack's restaurant. Vicky's father doesn't approve of Jack or of their living arrangement so he buys Jack's restaurant and is constantly dropping in to disrupt their relationship. Thus 'Three's a Crowd'. \n\n\nThis is the complete series of the show. It lasted only for one season (22 episodes), which is not surprising considering how bad it was.\n\nThis show was never released on DVD or VHS (for good reason, it sucked lol) All credit goes to TheDoctor08 who recorded the episodes when they aired on Deja-Vu tv and did the hard work of editing out all the commercials. He uploaded them as a set of 3 home-made DVD's here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4037891/Three_s_Company_-_Threes_a_Crowd_-_Complete_%281984%29_John_R\n\nI just took it to the next logical step which is encoding them all into single file episodes in mp4. Same quality but smaller overall file size with no need for burning or discs, just stick them on a memory stick and play it on your media player, ps3, smart phone etc.. I've labelled them all as ep01 to ep22 with the episode titles in the filenames. There was only 1 season of the show. \n\nUploaders note; If you were a fan of Three's Company but never saw this show, don't expect it to be anywhere near as funny as the former. Three's a Crowd was a very lame spinoff, it was meant to make a bigger star out of John Ritter but it failed miserably. It has unfunny scripts, a lousy supporting cast, and very annoying characters such as 'E.Z. Taylor', the dumb surfer dude. Horrible acting! A very pale shadow of what Three's Company was. This is really for die-hard Three's Company fans only, those who want to collect everything related to that show.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3f3613f876da0697b6a75b253748003c675d054","amp;dn":"Three%27s+a+Crowd+%281984%29+Complete+Series+in+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3f3613f876da0697b6a75b253748003c675d054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,243,97,63,135,109,160,105,123,106,117,178,83,116,128,3,198,117,208,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
