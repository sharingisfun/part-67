It contains 4 releases...\n\n * 2010 - Actions Speak Louder Than Words - Single\n * 2010 - Applause, Vol 1\n * 2011 - Spring Fling\n * 2012 - Wake Up\n\nSwoope is having a strong follow up to his independent project Ã¢â‚¬Å“ZooÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. After signing to Collision Records in 2011 he dropped mixtapes Ã¢â‚¬Å“Applause Vol 1.Ã¢â‚¬Å“, #1 Christian and Gospel single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Actions Speak LouderÃ¢â‚¬Å“, that raised money for orphans in Sudan (featuring Lecrae, Tedashii and Jai), LP Ã¢â‚¬Å“Spring FlingÃ¢â‚¬Å“, and his highly anticipated album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wake UpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is coming 03/20/12. Swoope draws comparisons from different mainstream artist such as Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco and Andre 3000 with his ability to deliver witty punch lines that challenge the cognition of avid Hip Hop listeners. What separates Swoope is his ability to play five instruments which allows him to produce the majority of his music. Many label Swoope as a musician who has the exceptional gift to rap and compose music. Swoope is truly becoming a pillar in the music industry; Collision is excited about what is in store for Swoope as an artist and ambassador for the gospel.\n\nBlessings,\nTorrentTracts - September 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cddd5210ba8a93c549e040fefa3f9280cac88375","amp;dn":"Swoope+Discography+2010-2012+%284+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cddd5210ba8a93c549e040fefa3f9280cac88375","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,221,82,16,186,138,147,197,73,224,64,254,250,63,146,128,202,200,131,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
