Tom's act is so magical and so unique, it has never been duplicated. All of us at one time or another have uttered the now-familiar refrain: &quot;Where in the heck did those cigarette go?&quot; And we were fooled over and over again.\n\nMurphy's Magic Supplies, Inc., is pleased to announce the release of Tom Mullica's Expert Cigarette Magic...Made Easy! on three DVDs (Available separately or as 3-DVD set). This remarkable collection contains basic to advanced magic with cigarettes, matches, cigars and anything else related to smoking. Of course, the topper is that on Vol. 3 he finally tips The Cigarette Eating Act! answering that age-old question: &quot;Where in the heck did those cigarettes go!&quot; As a bonus, Vol. 2 also contains Tom's F.I.S.M. act, and Vol. 3 also contains a performance of Tom's world-famous stage act!\n\nVol.1 - Cigarette Magic (Note: 'Vol.12' refers to the original VHS release)\n\n    Basic Sleights &amp; Theory\n    Distant Light\n    Swivel Vanish\n    Lorayne Vanish\n    Cigarette On Forehead\n    Cigarette Gymnastics\n    4-Cig Production\n    Pantomime Cig #1\n    Double-Ended Cig\n    Cig Vanish In Hank #1\n    Cig Vanish In Hank #2\n    Cigarette Sneeze\n    Vegas Carpet\n    Little Butt\n    Rising Cigarette\n    L.L.
