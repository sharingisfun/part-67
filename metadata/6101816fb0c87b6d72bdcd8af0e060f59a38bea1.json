Today, we think of Neanderthals as crude and clumsy, easily driven to extinction by the lithe, smart humans who came out of Africa some 100,000 years ago. But Clive Finlayson reminds us that the Neanderthals were another kind of human, and their culture was not so very different from that of our own ancestors. In this book, he presents a wider view of the events that led to the migration of the moderns into Europe, what might have happened during the contact between the two populations, and what finally drove the Neanderthals to extinction. It is a view that considers climate, ecology, and migrations of populations, as well as culture and interaction. His conclusion is that the destiny of the Neanderthals was sealed by ecological factors--in short, a major climate change--and it was a matter of luck that we survived while they perished.\n\n\n# Paperback: 256 pages\n# Publisher: Oxford University Press, USA (December 9, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0199239193\n# ISBN-13: 978-0199239191","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6101816fb0c87b6d72bdcd8af0e060f59a38bea1","amp;dn":"The+Humans+Who+Went+Extinct+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6101816fb0c87b6d72bdcd8af0e060f59a38bea1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,1,129,111,176,200,123,109,114,189,205,138,240,224,96,245,154,56,190,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
