She and some of her sister nuns rolled across the heartland on a bus trip designed to arouse public concern over what the Ryan plan would mean for social services in America, especially its slashing of programs for the poor. Sister Simone says his budget is inconsistent with Catholic social teaching. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops agrees.\n\nBut other Catholics say Sister Simone and the nuns have crossed a line. Robert Royal, editor in chief of The Catholic Thing and founder of the Faith &amp; Reason Institute, believes that issues of economic inequality are being oversimplified. Royal says the focus should be on creating a more dynamic economy for all.\n\nIn this episode, watch our field report from producers who rode along on the Ã¢â‚¬ËœNuns on the BusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tour, then join a passionate, candid discussion about faith and economics with Sister Simone and Royal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca9c9afda5079ba7eb76cd7b8f820025cb4cf4b9","amp;dn":"Nuns%2C+Faith+and+Politics.Moyers+and+Company.082412.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca9c9afda5079ba7eb76cd7b8f820025cb4cf4b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,156,154,253,165,7,155,167,235,118,205,123,143,130,0,37,203,76,244,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
