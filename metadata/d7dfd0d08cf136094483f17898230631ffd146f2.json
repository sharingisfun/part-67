Tribute\n\nThe Diggin' in the Crates Crew, also known as D.I.T.C., is a New York-based hip-hop collective, deriving its name from the art of seeking out records to sample for production. Its members have achieved substantial and consistent recognition in underground rap circles, often collaborating with undiscovered talent and underground artists alongside the most commercial of rappers. All of its members are from the Bronx, with the exception of Big L (from Harlem) and O.C. (from Brooklyn).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7dfd0d08cf136094483f17898230631ffd146f2","amp;dn":"Diggin%27+in+the+Crates+Crew+-+D.I.T.C.+%5B2000%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7dfd0d08cf136094483f17898230631ffd146f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,223,208,208,140,241,54,9,68,131,241,120,152,35,6,49,255,209,70,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
