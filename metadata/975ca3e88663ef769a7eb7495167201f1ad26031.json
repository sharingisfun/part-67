Broderick and Elwes are the idealistic youn Bostonians who lead the regiment; Freeman is the inspirational sergeant who unites the troops; and Denzel Washington, in an Oscar winning performance (1989 Best Supporting Actor) is the runaway slave who embodies the indomitable spirit of the 54th Regiment of Massachusetts.\n\nShaw was an officer in the Federal Army during the American Civil War who volunteered to lead the first company of black soldiers. Shaw was forced to deal with the prejudices of both the enemy (who had orders to kill commanding officers of blacks), and of his own fellow officers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:975ca3e88663ef769a7eb7495167201f1ad26031","amp;dn":"Glory+%281989%29+%5Beng+subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"975ca3e88663ef769a7eb7495167201f1ad26031","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,92,163,232,134,99,239,118,154,126,183,73,81,103,32,31,26,210,96,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
