What begins as a stand-offish friendship grows into a deep love and appreciation for the companionship both have longed for.  The beginning of &quot;Watercolors&quot; is also its conclusion, however the film is certain to tug at one's heartstrings.  Definitely a three-hanky movie!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc26959cdde9a89bbef92c5c5f62a1e2caae92a3","amp;dn":"WATERCOLORS.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc26959cdde9a89bbef92c5c5f62a1e2caae92a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,38,149,156,221,233,168,155,190,249,44,92,95,98,161,226,202,174,146,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
