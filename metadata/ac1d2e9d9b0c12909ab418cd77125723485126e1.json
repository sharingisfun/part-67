Originally formed in 1964 as the &quot;Noble Five&quot; in Jacksonville, Florida, the band rose to worldwide recognition on the basis of its driving live performances and signature tunes &quot;Sweet Home Alabama,&quot; and &quot;Free Bird.&quot; At the peak of their success, three members died in an airplane crash in 1977, putting an abrupt end to the band's most popular incarnation.\n\nSurviving members re-formed in 1987 for a reunion tour with lead singer Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother Johnny as frontman. A version of the band continues to tour and record, with only Gary Rossington of its original members remaining as of 2012. Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStreet Survivors is the fifth studio album by Southern rock band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, released on October 17, 1977. The LP is the last Skynyrd album recorded by original members Ronnie Van Zant and Allen Collins, and is the sole Skynyrd studio recording by guitarist Steve Gaines. Three days after the album's release, on October 20, 1977, the band's chartered airplane crashed en route to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, killing the pilot, co-pilot, the group's assistant road-manager and three band members (Van Zant, Gaines, and Steve's older sister, backup singer Cassie Gaines), and severely injuring most who survived the crash. The album performed well on the charts, peaking at #5 (their first top 5 album), as did the singles &quot;What's Your Name&quot; and &quot;That Smell&quot;, the former a top 20 hit on the singles chart.\n\nThe album was an instant success, achieving gold certification just ten days after its release. It would later go on to go double platinum.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac1d2e9d9b0c12909ab418cd77125723485126e1","amp;dn":"Lynyrd+Skynyrd+-+Street+Survivors+%5B1977%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac1d2e9d9b0c12909ab418cd77125723485126e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,29,46,157,155,12,18,144,154,180,24,205,119,18,87,35,72,81,38,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
