In addition, you also control Eddie Brock, a childhood friend who took a prototype experiment of his and Peter's fathers to become the murderous monster, Venom. While you help the innocent among your challenges as Spider-Man, you also rampage as Venom as events build to a final confrontation that both allies like Nick Fury or enemies like The Vulture cannot prevent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf711a419e223028687ce0126ebc7873a2d5925c","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Spider+Man+%28No+RAR%29_%28Direct+Play%29.Legend2000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf711a419e223028687ce0126ebc7873a2d5925c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,113,26,65,158,34,48,40,104,124,224,18,110,188,120,115,162,213,146,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
