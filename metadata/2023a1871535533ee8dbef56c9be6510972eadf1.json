All legal, yes, but not something that everyday Americans can do.\n\nDavid Cay Johnston (columnist for Reuters, Pulitzer Prize winner, author of Perfectly Legal and Free Lunch), will give us the details and Eugene Robinson, MSNBC Analyst and Associate Editor and Pulitzer Prize winning columnist for the Washington Post, will join Ed to discuss the politics.\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney never apologized for shooting someone in the face. But Sarah PalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got him running scared. Bob Shrum (Democratic strategist) will weigh in on the power of Palin.\n\nThe Obama campaign continues its push to open up early voting for all Ohioans. Now some military groups are joining the fight. Rep. Betty Sutton (D-OH) will join Ed for that.\n\nPresident Obama slams Romney on his bogus tax plan and Mitt fights back with sandwich meat. The panel Joy Reid (Managing Editor of TheGrio.com and MSNBC Contributor) Keli Goff (Political Correspondent at TheRoot.com), and Mark Simone (radio talk show host) will weigh in on Romney's laundry list of problems.\n\nMitt Romney lets his true colors shine with another &quot;out of touch&quot; moment. You won't believe what the unemployed millionaire picked up. And in the Big Finish, another day, another lie from the Romney campaign: this time it's about welfare. Jonathan Alter (MSNBC Political Analyst and Bloomberg View columnist), has reaction and analysis.
