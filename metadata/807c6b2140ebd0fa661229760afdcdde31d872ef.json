To his interpretations of the works of Elgar and Vaughan Williams he brought great wisdom, selfless dedication and enormous authority.  He excelled, too, in the music of Gustav Holst, whose suite &quot;The Planets&quot;, perhaps more than any other piece in Boult's repertory, is most closely associated with his distinguished career.  One of the greatest recordings available for each work.  Words cannot do it justice - one must listen.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\nELGAR: ENIGMA VARIATIONS\n1. Theme (Andante)\n2. I. C.A.E. \n3. II.
