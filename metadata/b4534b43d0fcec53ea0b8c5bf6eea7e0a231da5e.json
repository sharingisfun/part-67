Icelanders wanted to stop fishing and become investment bankers. The Greeks wanted to turn their country into a pi ata stuffed with cash and allow as many citizens as possible to take a whack at it. The Germans wanted to be even more German; the Irish wanted to stop being Irish. Michael Lewis's investigation of bubbles beyond our shores is so brilliantly, sadly hilarious that it leads the American reader to a comfortable complacency: oh, those foolish foreigners. But when he turns a merciless eye on California and Washington, DC, we see that the narrative is a trap baited with humor, and we understand the reckoning that awaits the greatest and greediest of debtor nations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4534b43d0fcec53ea0b8c5bf6eea7e0a231da5e","amp;dn":"Boomerang+-+Michael+Lewis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4534b43d0fcec53ea0b8c5bf6eea7e0a231da5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,83,75,67,208,252,236,83,234,11,140,91,246,238,167,224,162,49,218,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
