Framed for murder and facing execution, he makes a daring escape from the Iron Point Maximum-Security Penitentiary. Driven to bring the criminal element that framed him to justice, Slate hunts the hunters in this gritty, crime-noir inspired epic. He finds himself alone and on the run trying to survive the hard streets of Grant City. Without a home and pitifully few friends, what Jack discovers sends him on a downward spiral into a labyrinth of corruption, betrayal and crime. With super-charged game play, jaw-dropping graphics and hard-boiled storytelling, Dead to Rights raises the bar on the crime action-thriller genre.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Download the torrent files;\n2) Mount or burn disc images;\n3) Run autorun.exe to install (make sure to select Full Installation option);\n4) After installation process is over, extract Crack.zip archive and run Imsdtr.exe to crack the game;\n5) Play the game without the discs.\n\n!

The developers of the game have released a patch to fix the issue, but it doesn't work with the provided crack.
