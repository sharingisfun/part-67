The story of the film, which is set in Bihar, dwells on the all-round exploitation of the backward communities and the atrocities perpetrated on them by a handful of powerful men who operate the Ã¢â‚¬ËœPanhaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ system, Ã¢â‚¬ËœPanhaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ meaning shelter and protection. The landlords trap potential bounded labourers into committing petty crimes (mostly planted) and then grant them shelter and protection when the police arrive. The labourers are left with no choice but to do the landlordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bidding Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they steal for them and pay back the loans, the stealing being mostly confined to cattle.\n\nAwards : 1985: National Film Award for Best Feature Film\n\nCredits to jetlee009 for the rip and U/L on tpb here\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7342973/Damul-1985-_%28prakash_jha_classic%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7342973/Damul-1985-_%28prakash_jha_classic%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast:\nAnnu Kapoor\nSreela Majumdar\nDeepti Naval\nManohar Singh\n\nMedia Info :\nLanguage - Hindi (Indian)\nVideo Size - 788 MB\nVideo Codec - AVC\nVideo Res - 640 x 480\nVideo Frame Rate - 29.970 fps\nVideo Bitrate - 901 Kbps\nSubtitles - English Hardsubbed\nAudio Codec - MP3\nChannels - Stereo\nSample Rate - 44100 Hz @ 128 kbps\nLength - 2 Hour 2 mins\n\nPosters:\n\n\nScreens :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTakes me 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 2 Hours to Upload &amp; Months to Seed\n\nTakes me 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\n\nTakes you just 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;.
