It was originally serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump from June 2002 to August 2005, with the 107 chapters collected into twelve tankÃ…ï¿½bon volumes. A thirteen-episode anime television series adaptation was produced by the studio Arms and broadcast on AT-X from July to October 2004. The anime was later licensed in North America on DVD by ADV Films.[2] The anime began airing before the manga was complete; as a result, the plot differed between the two, especially the ending. The series' title is German for &quot;Elf Song&quot; and takes its name from the poem &quot;Elfenlied&quot;, which is featured in the story.\n\nElfen Lied revolves around the interactions, views, emotions, and differences between human beings and the Diclonii, a mutant species similar to humans in build but distinguishable by two horns on their heads and &quot;vectors&quot;, transparent telekinetically controlled arms that have the power to manipulate and cut objects within their reach. The series is centered on the teenage Diclonius girl &quot;Lucy&quot; who was rejected by human beings and subsequently wants revenge.\n\nElfen Lied involves themes of social alienation, identity, prejudice, revenge, abuse, jealousy, regret and the value of humanity.[3] The series employs graphic violence and profanity. So far, only the thirteen-episode anime series has been licensed in the US, by ADV Films and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. ADV Films said the series was one of their bestselling and &quot;most notorious&quot; releases of 2005.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ad20912353510e3fa5a603011036d6075356673","amp;dn":"Elfen.Leid%5B1-13%5D%5BEnglishDub%5D%5B.MP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ad20912353510e3fa5a603011036d6075356673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,210,9,18,53,53,16,227,250,90,96,48,17,3,109,96,117,53,102,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
