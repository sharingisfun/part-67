From the exotic, trackless expanses and sand dunes of MongoliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gobi Desert to the dramatic sandstone buttes of New Mexico, the film follows American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) paleontologists as they explore some of the greatest dinosaur finds in history. Through the magic of scientifically accurate computer generated animation, these newly uncovered creatures, and some familiar favorites, come aliveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦in a big way!\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf5f8a99fa7a23bec2a4e46a8903b4b588e6eead","amp;dn":"Dinosaurs+alive+3D+full+BD.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf5f8a99fa7a23bec2a4e46a8903b4b588e6eead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,95,138,153,250,122,35,190,194,164,228,106,137,3,180,181,136,230,238,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
