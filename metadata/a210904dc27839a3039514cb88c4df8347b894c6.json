Goyer. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the third and final installment in Nolan's Batman film trilogy, and it is the sequel to The Dark Knight (2008). Christian Bale reprises the lead role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, with a returning cast of Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane. The film introduces two main characters to Nolan's series: Selina Kyle (played by Anne Hathaway), a cat burglar whose appearance in Gotham City sets in motion a chain of events that leads Batman to come out of retirement; and Bane (played by Tom Hardy), a mercenary whose objective is to destroy Gotham with a nuclear fusion bomb.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a210904dc27839a3039514cb88c4df8347b894c6","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Knight+Rises","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a210904dc27839a3039514cb88c4df8347b894c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,16,144,77,194,120,57,163,3,149,20,203,136,196,223,131,71,184,148,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
