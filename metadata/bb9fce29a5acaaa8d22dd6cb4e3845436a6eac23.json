It is also the eighth installment in the revised and expanded &quot;Great Lives&quot; series, which provides in-depth critical essays on important men and women in all areas of achievement. This brand new, ten-volume set offers more than 1,300 extensive biographies of major personages in world history from 1901-2000.This set is broad in scope, both geographically and in terms of the individuals' areas of achievement. The personages covered are identified with several different regions, including Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and South America.The coverage is broad in areas of achievement as well as geography, and includes those persons recognized for shaping history, coverage that is essential in any liberal arts curriculum. Major world leaders appear here, as well as religious leaders, philosophers, educators, and theologians who left their imprint on political and spiritual institutions. The set also includes figures who have received little attention in the past, particularly women and people of color who also had significant achievements throughout the century.Each essay ranges from 1,500 to 3,000 words in length (3 to 5 pages) and displays standard ready-reference top matter offering easy access to biographical information including the individual's name, nationality, occupation, area of achievement, and dates of birth and death. Also included is a summary paragraph highlighting the individual's historical importance and indicating why the person is studied today.The body of each essay is divided into three major sections: &quot;Early Life&quot; provides facts about the individual's upbringing and the environment in which he or she was reared. &quot;Life's Work,&quot; the heart of the essay, consists of a straightforward, generally chronological account of the period during which the individual's most significant achievements were accomplished. Lastly, &quot;Significance&quot; provides an overview of the individual's place in history.The front matter includes a complete list of contents, a pronunciation key, lists of maps and sidebars, and a section of maps displaying major regions of the world during the twentieth century.Several appendixes and indexes can be found at the end of Volume 10, including a table of Rulers and Heads of State, a chronological list of personages, and 4 complete indexes.\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 5261 pages\n# Publisher: Salem Pr; Har/Psc edition (September 30, 2008)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 158765346X\n# ISBN-13: 978-1587653469\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb9fce29a5acaaa8d22dd6cb4e3845436a6eac23","amp;dn":"Great+Lives+from+History-The+20th+Century%2C1901-2000%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb9fce29a5acaaa8d22dd6cb4e3845436a6eac23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,159,206,41,165,172,170,168,210,45,214,203,78,56,69,67,106,110,172,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
