This textbook assumes no programming language experience. The writing is nontechnical and emphasizes good programming practices. The examples are business examples; they do not assume mathematical background beyond high school business math. Additionally, the examples illustrate one or two major points; they do not contain so many features that students become lost following irrelevant and extraneous details.\n\nRe-upped with OCR on the PDF and the overall file size is reduced quite a bit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fb03fde450577a4dd93ed35173b7d2098c702bb","amp;dn":"An+Object-Oriented+Approach+to+Programming+Logic+and+Design+Thir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fb03fde450577a4dd93ed35173b7d2098c702bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,176,63,222,69,5,119,164,221,147,237,53,23,59,125,32,152,199,2,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
