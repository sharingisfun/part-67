She is fearless, outspoken, and the best in the world at what she does: protecting the goal of the U.S. women's soccer team. Her outsized talent has led her to the pinnacle of her sportÃ¢â‚¬â€the Olympics and the World CupÃ¢â‚¬â€and made her into an international celebrity who is just as likely to appear on ABC's Dancing with the Stars as she is on the covers of Sports Illustrated, ESPN The Magazine, and Vogue. But her journeyÃ¢â‚¬â€which began in Richland, Washington, where she was raised by her strong-willed mother on the scorched earth of defunct nuclear testing sitesÃ¢â‚¬â€is similarly haunted by the fallout of her family history. Her father, a philanderer and con man, was convicted of embezzlement when Solo was an infant. She lost touch with him as he drifted out of prison and into homelessness. By the time they reunited, years later, in the parking lot of a grocery store, she was an All-American goalkeeper at the University of Washington and already a budding prospect for the U.S. national team. He was living in the woods.\n\n                           Format 1 - Epub\n\n                           Format 2 - Mobi\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f562fc45877bb386a22f7286e8902ba6c179483d","amp;dn":"Solo+A+Memoir+of+Hope+by+Hope+Solo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f562fc45877bb386a22f7286e8902ba6c179483d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,98,252,69,135,123,179,134,162,47,114,134,232,144,43,166,193,121,72,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
