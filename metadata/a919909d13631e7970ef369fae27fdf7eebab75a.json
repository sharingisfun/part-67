With characteristic narrative panache, Ackroyd immerses us in sixteenth-century Stratford and the rural landscapeÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe industry, the animals, even the flowersÃ¢â‚¬â€œthat would appear in ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plays. He takes us through ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s London neighborhood and the fertile, competitive theater world where he worked as actor and writer. He shows us Shakespeare as a businessman, and as a constant reviser of his writing. In joining these intimate details with profound intuitions about the playwright and his work, Ackroyd has produced an altogether engaging masterpiece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a919909d13631e7970ef369fae27fdf7eebab75a","amp;dn":"Shakespeare+the+Biography+-+Peter+Ackroyd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a919909d13631e7970ef369fae27fdf7eebab75a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,25,144,157,19,99,30,121,112,239,54,159,174,39,253,247,238,186,183,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
