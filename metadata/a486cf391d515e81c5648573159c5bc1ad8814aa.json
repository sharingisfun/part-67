By singing they are glorifying God and they never stopped believing and hoping that 1 day they will be able to see again. With God's help they wil restore their vision by having their eye surgery in San Francisco. Therefore they are collecting donations for that. As those retina implants are very expensive sometimes over 100000$ for each eye every donation would be highly appreciated.\nIf you are a person of good heart and if you also want to help these 2 young people to see this beautiful world please check their website for donations and share it with your friends. May God bless you. Let's enjoy in this wonderful music and never stop praying for them. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sight4hopeandfreedom.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sight4hopeandfreedom.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a486cf391d515e81c5648573159c5bc1ad8814aa","amp;dn":"Orthodox+spiritual+and+traditional+music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a486cf391d515e81c5648573159c5bc1ad8814aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,134,207,57,29,81,94,129,197,100,133,115,21,156,91,193,173,136,20,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
