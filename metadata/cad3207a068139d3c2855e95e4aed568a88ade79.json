The series has been going for over a decade Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and is well-known for bringing amazing other-worldly sounds to a much wider audience Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tunes recorded in Ethiopia during the 60s and 70s, rarely with original exposure to the outside world, and often featuring exotic reed passages, spacey keyboards, and some of the weirdest rhythms you'll ever hear! This 2CD set is a great way to dig the Ethiopiques groove without having to randomly buy the few dozen titles in the collection Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and it's supported by great notes aimed at newcomers to the music. This package is different than a similarly-titled collection that was out a few years ago.~dustygroove\n\n''The 27-volume 'Ethiopiques' series introduced the unique sounds of post-war Ethiopian soul, jazz and big bands to a grateful wider world. This collection takes 28 of the very best cuts from that series to form a unique document of this incredibly soulful, otherworldly and hypnotic music.''\n\nDisc 1\n01.
