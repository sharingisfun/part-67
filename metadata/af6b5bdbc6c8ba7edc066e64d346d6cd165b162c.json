It was a little bit tricky, but it works. Next times i take a picture with a darker background or i paint it dark. I have a little burning in my eyes, after looking million of hours in the white space. \nNo, it's not the onion trick, to get a present. =)\n\nOk, back. I've included several aspect ratios and a .psd file. This file contains a layer with the blue Vignette. If you don't like the blue corners, open the .psd with Photoshop or Gimp, deactivate the layer (i've named it vignette, yeah!) and save the picture again.\n\nForget anything? Aaah, coming soon: Looks like, that the most of you wishes pictures from Sandra. I prefer Ella, but ok. Take a look around in the  folders... Found FGS 073 with a dark background, i've warned you. Seems like a good choice.\n\nToday at saturday i will do some offline things. Please be patient.\n\nBest regards and have a nice day!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af6b5bdbc6c8ba7edc066e64d346d6cd165b162c","amp;dn":"Fame-Girls+Sandra+Single+Painting+%28II%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af6b5bdbc6c8ba7edc066e64d346d6cd165b162c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,107,91,219,198,200,186,126,220,6,110,100,211,70,214,205,22,91,22,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
