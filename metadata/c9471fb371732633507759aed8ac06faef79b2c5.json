Here, for the first time, he tells the story of his lifelong obsession with football, in an honest and revealing book which captures the extraordinary camaraderie, the teeth-grinding tension and the high-octane thrills of the modern game as never before.\n\nA relatively private figure, Steven has rarely spoken out in public. Now, his legions of fans are allowed an intimate glimpse of what makes their hero tick. He describes for the first time the torturous will-he-won't-he Chelsea rumors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and his undying passion for Liverpool. We experience first-hand the highs of winning in Istanbul and elsewhere, as well as the lows of being parted from his much-loved family and friends. And, of course, the book contains a full blow-by-blow account of England's World Cup campaign in Germany 2006 and LiverpoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2006Ã¢â‚¬â€œ07 season.\n\nSteven GerrardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book is the definitive football autobiography. Like its subject, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s honest, passionate and exhilarating. If Steven Gerrard isn't your hero yet, by the time you've read this he will beÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nPaperback: 320 pages\nPublisher: Transworld Publishers; Airport / Export ed edition (September 26, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0593054814\nISBN-13: 978-0593054819\nProduct Dimensions: 9 x 6 x 1.4 inches\nShipping Weight: 1.4 pounds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9471fb371732633507759aed8ac06faef79b2c5","amp;dn":"Steven+Gerrard+My+Autobiography+Complete+PDF+format","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9471fb371732633507759aed8ac06faef79b2c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,71,31,179,113,115,38,51,80,119,89,174,216,172,6,250,239,121,178,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
