But for Tim Hart, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the only way to sing. Redemptive and rollicking, Milling The Wind is the debut album from this talented Sydney singer/songwriter: 12 tracks of folk-inspired finery, from gentle, finger picked odes (Ã¢â‚¬Å“ArchitectsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Old GateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) to jaunty, banjo offerings (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cover Of Your CodeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and dark, under bellied ballads (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Borrowed &amp; VacantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). Steeped in tradition but looking firmly to the future, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an album that sits close to the bone for its young creator.
