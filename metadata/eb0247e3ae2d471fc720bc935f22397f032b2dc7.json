This means: no painstaking detective work showing the cops identifying and then tracking their prey; a refusal to try and Ã¢â‚¬ËœexplainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the killer (itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s based on a true story); and, most importantly, the majority of the killings occur offscreen, so thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no gruesome fetishisation of the murders themselves.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left is a compelling, stark tale with no answers that is by turns fascinating and horrifying.\n\nExcerpt from Matthew Turner's review at ViewLondon\n\n***\n\nMaking his acting debut, Cassetti is frighteningly plausible as the real-life multiple killer of the title. He's first seen (years after the Italian cops discover of his parents' bodies) in a Toulon disco, where, he picks up a teenage girl who over the next few months shows remarkably little curiosity despite his strange and volatile behaviour. Indeed, his ability to continue killing, stealing and living out his strange fantasies is due partly to luck, partly to the shortcomings of others (including the cops), partly to his own extraordinarily uninhibited character. Kahn never opts for easy explanations but presents the facts coolly to subtly build up a portrait of the world where disorder rules, where notions of 'good' and 'evil' are finally so inadequate as to be meaningless. Tough, and very impressive indeed.\n\nExcerpt from TimeOut Film Guide\n\n\nSource\tdvdrip\nRip Specs\tFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,237,352,448 bytes \nRuntime ............................................: 01:59:34 \n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD \nFrame Size ......................................: 640x260 (AR: 2.462) \nFPS .................................................: 25.000 \nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1117 kb/s \nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.269 bpp \nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [N-VOP], [], [] \n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000(AC3, Dolby Laboratories, Inc) AC3 \nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz \nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 256 kb/s [5 channel(s)] CBR \nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\nUpped KG: forestier\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0247e3ae2d471fc720bc935f22397f032b2dc7","amp;dn":"Roberto+Succo+%28Kahn%2C+2001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0247e3ae2d471fc720bc935f22397f032b2dc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,2,71,227,174,45,71,31,199,32,188,147,95,34,57,127,3,43,45,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
