Easy to read and understand. Book can be read in a few hours. The author is a former soldier and military analyst so he has a good understanding of the conditions that create civil war. The book was originally published in 1996 and now you see some of his predictions are coming true. I recommend the book. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Civil-War-II-Breakup-America/dp/144047639X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345746419&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=civil+war+two&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Civil-War-II-Breakup-America/dp/144047639X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345746419&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=civil+war+two&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2c600070e23193454c36e4c668ee3a382ed3fed","amp;dn":"Civil+War+II%3A+The+Coming+Breakup+Of+America+%28RESEED%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2c600070e23193454c36e4c668ee3a382ed3fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,198,0,7,14,35,25,52,84,195,110,76,102,142,227,163,130,237,63,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
