Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c77f5645cad12e1965224a3a24b738263e772560","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+20+%5B480p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c77f5645cad12e1965224a3a24b738263e772560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,127,86,69,202,209,46,25,101,34,74,58,36,183,56,38,62,119,37,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
