Foreign aid goes to our enemies. Pakistan uses our money to fund terrorists who attack us. Saudi Arabia, which our soldiers have defended with their lives, funds 90 percent of the world's Islamic fundamentalism. The UN is awash in corruption; its bureaucrats steal the money we give it with total impunity. Fifteen hundred brave American soldiers have died defending the regime in Afghanistan--rated the second-most corrupt in the world Meanwhile, European bankers and bureaucrats are taking over our economy and preempting our sovereignty.\n\nHow do they get away with it? By hiring our own political leaders, as soon as they leave office, to lobby for them to rip us off. Former House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt, for example, sits on the board of an American affiliate of a Chinese company that has been denied the right to operate in the United States because it steals our technology. Former House Republican Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingstone represented Libya until just before Gaddafi fell. And we have a president who willingly obliges countries that poach on our sovereignty, refusing to stand up for our interests and our jobs as they confiscate half the royalties from our offshore energy, subject our elected leaders to criminal prosecution if they go to war without UN approval, and tell us what kind of land-use policies we should pursue.\n\nIn &quot;Screwed ,&quot; bestselling authors Dick Morris and Eileen McGann lay bare the unvarnished facts as never before and suggest real, immediate, and specific steps to stop those who undermine our interests and take away our jobs. In the same vein as their previous crusading books--&quot;Catastrophe,&quot; &quot;Fleeced,&quot; and &quot;Outrage&quot;--Morris and McGann have documented, in great depth and detail, exactly how the United States is getting screwed, and how to stop it. They dig up the facts, name names, point fingers, and suggest concrete solutions--independent of partisan politics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a684888e4e3835a29c6fce4cc02e5370f7397ba3","amp;dn":"Screwed%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a684888e4e3835a29c6fce4cc02e5370f7397ba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,132,136,142,78,56,53,162,156,111,206,76,192,46,83,112,247,57,123,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
