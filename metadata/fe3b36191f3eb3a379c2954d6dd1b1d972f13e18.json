Just keeping alive!\n\nMarine biologist Chaz Perrone can't tell a sea horse from a sawhorse. And when he throws his beautiful wife, Joey, off a cruise liner, he really should know better. An expert swimmer, Joey makes her way to a floating bale of Jamaican pot-and then to an island inhabited by an ex-cop named Mick Stanahan whose ex-wives include five waitresses and a TV producer. Now Joey wants to get revenge on Chaz and Mick's happy to help her. But in swampy South Florida, separating lies from truths and stupidity from brilliance isn't easy. Especially when you're after a guy like Chaz-who's bad at murder, great at fraud, and just terrible at getting caught...\n\nKeep Seeding!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe3b36191f3eb3a379c2954d6dd1b1d972f13e18","amp;dn":"Skinny+Dip%3B+Carl+Hiaasen+%28Mobi%2C+Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe3b36191f3eb3a379c2954d6dd1b1d972f13e18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,59,54,25,31,62,179,163,121,194,149,77,109,209,177,217,114,241,62,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
