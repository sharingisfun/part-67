And at the same time, Black Nasty was too funky and soul-oriented for FM rock radio. So Black Nasty fell through the cracks in the early to mid-'70s, although it enjoyed some commercial success after evolving into the ADC Band and recording the major funk hit of 1978, &quot;Long Stroke.&quot; The band's only album as Black Nasty, Talking to the People, was a commercial disappointment but a creative triumph. Those who savored the Motor City funk/rock experiments of Rare Earth and early Funkadelic will find a lot to admire about gritty, hard-edged smokers like &quot;Nasty Soul,&quot; &quot;Getting Funky Round Here,&quot; and the single &quot;Black Nasty Boogie&quot; (which brings to mind John Lee Hooker's work with Canned Heat). To its credit, Black Nasty has no problem turning around and providing silky, mellow slow jams such as &quot;Rushin' Sea&quot; and &quot;I Must Be in Love,&quot; both of which feature singer Audrey Matthews. It is Nasty's other lead singer, Terrance Ellis, who handles the more up-tempo gems. Originally a vinyl LP, Talking to the People was reissued on CD in 1999.\n\n1. Talking To The People\n2.
