It's one of those. Also, it has fighting game matches in between stages.\n\nI can't find any other information or download link for this, even on the website I originally found it on. I only found it while googling a .dll that apparently is only used for this and one other game that doesn't even work.\n\nPlatformer controls: z to charge jump, release z to jump.\nFighter controls: z to throw spears, x to jump, double tap arrow keys to dash. Arrow keys to move.\n\nIf you have any information about this game, please leave it in the comments, because I have a burning desire to know about just WTF is going on with this &gt;_","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc9c61839d62b1fdc4fcf9e8b5ce9da5375dc396","amp;dn":"Masai+%28Japanese+Game%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc9c61839d62b1fdc4fcf9e8b5ce9da5375dc396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,156,97,131,157,98,177,253,196,252,249,232,181,206,157,165,55,93,195,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
