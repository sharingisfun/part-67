The syntax to use is:\n\nAtomicParsley  -f true\n\nUnless the file is already flagged as a podcast (in which case, choose 'false')\nthis rewrites the MP4 header so that it now thinks it's a podcast. Since the\nCC2AVI process does not carry this info to the AVI - this doesn't matter.\nWhat matters is that the header information is rewritten so you no longer\nget an error.\n\nThere are a couple of items that still may not lend themselves to dissection\nThat's where MP4Muxer comes in. Demux, remux &amp; MP4Cam2AVI works\nFingers crossed.\n\nHave all those MP4 files and an old tablet that can't play them?\nWant to use your favorite AVI editing tools?\nWish you could back up frame by frame in Media Player Classic?\nNow you too can turn any MP4 encode into your favorite AVI.\n\n--------------------\n\nI choose to remain (mostly) anonymous because we are being watched.\n... OK, because I'm paranoid ... that doesn't mean we're not being watched.\nI don't do movies (MPAA) or music (RIAA), but I'm still not sure if it's safe.\nYou don't need to know me - you only need to know my work.\n\nI NEVER claim an x264 encoding credit. I GIVE proper credit where due.\n\nMy offerings are clearly identifiable:\nuse search term &quot;x264.MP3*.avi&quot;\nWithout quotes for TPB.\nWith quotes for Google.\n\nSo, you've probably seen the last of MP4SUX XVID AVI encodes.\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c699430ef9b976ec379f503900a5094f2c556fa","amp;dn":"Doctor.Who.Amy.Pond.Preview.x264.MP3-oan.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c699430ef9b976ec379f503900a5094f2c556fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,105,148,48,239,155,151,110,195,121,245,3,144,10,80,148,242,197,86,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
