Nearing death, he discovers a natural spring and he's soon at the nearest town to register a land claim. There he meets a pretty local prostitute, Hildy. Back at his claim site, he christens it Cable Springs and opens a stagecoach station where the horses can be watered and the passengers fed. Hildy soon joins him but only temporarily as she has dreams of moving to San Francisco and setting herself up there in her own popular line of business. Things are going well for Cable when, to his delight, his former partners show up. This time he's prepared for them. When Hildy returns after a long absence he's ready to pack it in and make his life with her but as is so often the case, fate intervenes.\n\n\n   General      \n      Complete name : The Ballad of Cable Hogue.mkv\n      Format : Matroska\n      File size : 4.37 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Overall bit rate : 5 162 Kbps\n   Video #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AVC\n      Format/Info : Advanced Video Codec\n      Codec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\n      Bit rate : 4 774 Kbps\n      Width : 1 280 pixels\n      Height : 720 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : AC-3\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 384 Kbps\n      Language : English\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065446/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065446/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English and Portuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:916255bf4dd41f44b0cbd173bbef8d726c7649f9","amp;dn":"The+Ballad+of+Cable+Hogue+1970+HDTV+720p+AC3+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"916255bf4dd41f44b0cbd173bbef8d726c7649f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,98,85,191,77,212,31,68,176,203,209,115,187,239,141,114,108,118,73,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
