THESE FILES WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT A PS3!!!\n\nTo play: navigate to the VIDEO section on the XMB (the PS3 reads these as video files, NOT audio files...but they work, trust me).\n\nEnjoy!  I hope you guys like it.  Be kind, this is my first run at a surround version.  I think it sounds great.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ae6b03476b3812fd2fa94e55079f80d9093f7e6","amp;dn":"Greg+Laswell+-+Landline+%28DTS+5.1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ae6b03476b3812fd2fa94e55079f80d9093f7e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,230,176,52,118,179,129,47,210,250,148,229,80,121,248,13,144,147,247,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
