G. Veljanovski (Repost)\n\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press (June 18, 2007) | ISBN: 0521873746 | Pages: \n300 | PDF | 1.4 MB\n\n Economic Principles of Law, first published in 2007, applies economics to the doctrines, rules and remedies of the common law. In plain English and using non-technical analysis, it offers an introduction and exposition of the 'economic approach' to law - one of the most exciting and vibrant fields of legal scholarship and applied economics. Beginning with a brief history of the field, it sets out the basic economic concepts useful to lawyers, and applies these to assess the core areas of the common law - property, contract, tort and crime - with particular emphasis on their doctrinal structure and remedies. This is done using leading cases drawn from the birthplace of the common law (England &amp; Wales) and other common law jurisdictions. The book serves as a primer to the wider use of economics which has become increasingly important for law students, lawyers, legislators, regulators and those concerned with our legal system generally.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d8c5839f68cdeba2a09ce14e2ac352cbe24ad83","amp;dn":"Economic+Principles+of+Law.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d8c5839f68cdeba2a09ce14e2ac352cbe24ad83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,140,88,57,246,140,222,186,42,9,206,20,226,172,53,44,190,36,173,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
