Iraq war veteran Jon Soltz (Chairman of Vote Vets), reacts to Romney's pathetic excuse for ignoring the troops.\n\nDemocrats speak out on women's issues, and they have the policies to back it up.  Ed asked Terry O'Neill (President of The National Organization for Women), if the Democrats made a convincing case to women.\n\nOhio's secretary of state is playing chicken with a federal judge over voter suppression.  State Sen. Nina Turner (D-OH) reacted to Friday's big news.\n\nClint Eastwood broke his silence about his bizarre performance at last week's Republican National Convention that took the country by storm.\n\nAnd in the Big Finish, NFL punter Chris Kluwe's stand for marriage equality had twitter on fire Friday night.  Chris Kluwe joined Ed for an EXCLUSIVE interview!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c2be96f4012ec9d98cab2437c5e2201cd8c5c17","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+9-7-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c2be96f4012ec9d98cab2437c5e2201cd8c5c17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,43,233,111,64,18,236,157,152,202,178,67,124,94,34,1,205,140,92,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
