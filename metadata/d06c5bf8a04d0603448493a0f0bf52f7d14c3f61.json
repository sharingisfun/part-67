If you enjoyed The Golden Compass but felt it didn't have enough Lovecraftian monsters in it, this book might be for you.\n\nFrom the amazon page: http://www.amazon.com/A-Latent-Dark-ebook/dp/B00919R7T8\n\nWhen Skyla looks at your shadow, your shadow stares back.\n\nSkyla has lived secretly within the city walls of Bollingbrook for eleven years, playing among the airship factories and trainyards. As one of the Gutter DistrictÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nameless destitute, it has gone undiscovered that she has a unique talent: when Skyla looks at a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shadow she sees through it and into another world. She can see peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fears, desires, their past sins--all as swimming, living creatures.\n\nHer mother has never told her the real reasons why they must remain hidden, never explained the true dangers that exist outside the city walls. But when her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past catches up with them both, Skyla finds she must flee out of the city and into a world still recovering from a second Dark Age, a world of adults with secrets only she can see.\n\nFor a stranger has recently moved into Bollingbrook, a man some call the Pope of the South, a witch hunter to some and a hero to others. When more children begin to disappear, suspicions are raised and an unlikely search party is formed to find Skyla in the hopes that they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t already too late.\n\n----\n\n\nI have been giving away free copies of this book for a while now to generate reviews and interest. I don't see this as being any different.\n\nAll I ask is that if you like the book, you leave a review or suggest the book to someone else. I'd love it if you bought the book, because that's how I make money. I use that money to pay my editor and to make my next book.... and so on.\n\nIf you are one of the few people to check it out, I hope you enjoy it, and I hope you maybe decide to help out an obscure, starving author.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d06c5bf8a04d0603448493a0f0bf52f7d14c3f61","amp;dn":"A+Latent+Dark+-+Martin+Kee+%28.mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d06c5bf8a04d0603448493a0f0bf52f7d14c3f61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,108,91,248,160,77,6,3,68,132,147,160,240,191,82,247,209,76,63,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
