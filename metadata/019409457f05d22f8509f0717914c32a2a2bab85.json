The game itself is just 96kILOBYTES in size and features some rather impressive lighting and texturing techniques, especially considering its tiny footprint. Don't expect any meaty gameplay, but Kreiger is still an impressive technical achievement\n\n\n\n\n SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\n512MB RAM &gt;&gt;SDRAM DDR2 ETC\n1.6GHZ PROCESSOR&gt;&gt;INTEL AMD ETC\nDIRECTX 9.0 ACCELERATION\nVIDEO CARD WITH 128MB RAM&gt;&gt;MUST HAVE A T&amp;L SUPPORT\nAND VERTEX SHADER MODEL 2.0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:019409457f05d22f8509f0717914c32a2a2bab85","amp;dn":"Krieger+%5BWorld%27s+Smallest+File+Size+Game%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"019409457f05d22f8509f0717914c32a2a2bab85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,148,9,69,127,5,210,47,133,9,240,113,121,20,195,42,42,43,171,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
