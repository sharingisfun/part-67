From the sunny green lawns of Connecticut to the cafÃƒÂ©s of London to the sandy beaches of Nantucket, Green draws from her own life to craft each delicious story and the resulting tales resonate with women everywhere.\n\nDune Road is another fun and fearless adventure that will take Green's many fans from laughter to tears and back again. The novel is set in the beach community of a tony Connecticut town. Our heroine is a single mom who works for a famous-and famously reclusive-novelist. When she stumbles on a secret that the great man has kept hidden for years, she knows that there are plenty of women in town who would love to get their hands on it-including some who fancy the writer for themselves. Dune Road is the story of life in an exclusive beach town after the tourists have left for the summer and the eccentric (and moneyed) community sticks around. Dune Road will surely be the book to pack in beach bags next summer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27bbc0b3cd1493ab029089b8607cd9ee089d6e6d","amp;dn":"Dune+Road+-+A+Novel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27bbc0b3cd1493ab029089b8607cd9ee089d6e6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,187,192,179,205,20,147,171,2,144,137,184,96,124,217,238,8,157,110,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
