Manipulative Physiotherapy, it is clear, has an important role to play within the recovery and rehabilitation process.\nThe ability to identify and deal with spinal segmental mobility impairment, neurodynamic dysfunction and muscle imbalance, for example, requires finely tuned\nskills of clinical examination, clinical reasoning and technically accurate and effective treatment techniques. \nThe Maitland Concept has been one of the cornerstones of modern manipulative physiotherapy. Those who have been privileged enough to see Geoff Maitland at work will know how much thought and detail goes into the application of each individual technique of examination, mobilisation or manipulation. Having the opportunity to see and practice techniques performed in an expert way can only serve to help any clinician to understand and apply manipulative phYSiotherapy methods more effectively in the clinical setting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e49391c6ae222af4fda245143f1a260be7130f9","amp;dn":"Maitland+2005+Vertebral+Manipulation+7th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e49391c6ae222af4fda245143f1a260be7130f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,73,57,28,106,226,34,175,79,218,36,81,67,241,162,96,190,113,48,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
