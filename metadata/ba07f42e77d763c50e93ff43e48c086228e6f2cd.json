On their first evening Russ, Carole's boyfriend who is on the island for a blues festival, shows up just in time to meet the women and save the conversation and the rest of the evening. A night out at Le Ti has the ladies enjoying tequila shots and a pirate-themed performance, led by the ladies' liaison, Tomas, a hot Johnny Depp look-alike. The next morning, rumor has it LuAnn kept the party going much later than anyone else.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba07f42e77d763c50e93ff43e48c086228e6f2cd","amp;dn":"The+Real+Housewives+Of+New+York+City+S05E13+Pirate+Booty+Call+mp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba07f42e77d763c50e93ff43e48c086228e6f2cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,7,244,46,119,215,99,197,14,147,255,67,228,140,8,98,40,230,242,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
