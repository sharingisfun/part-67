It airs Sunday at noon on \n\nRadio One and Saturday at 10 a.m. on Radio Two, and is also available as a podcast, \n\nalthough the podcasts are usually just McLean's stories.\n\nThese are full episodes that were recorded with Audacity from the On-line radio broadcast.\n\nThe show features essays, weird stuff, fiction and music; while frequently humorous, the \n\nweekly programs are also often wistfully nostalgic. The show also endeavours to introduce \n\nlisteners to new Canadian musical talent.\n\nThe show is independently produced by McLean and sold to the CBC. Each season has \n\napproximately 22 new episodes. Half of those are recorded in the studio and the other half \n\nare done with live audiences in theatres across Canada.\n\nA major feature of many of McLean's shows are the &quot;Dave and Morley Stories,&quot; featuring a \n\nfictional Toronto family. The name &quot;Vinyl Cafe&quot; refers both to the show's musical content, \n\nand the fictional record shop owned by McLean's character Dave. This aspect of the show has \n\nspawned a number of books of short stories, as well as audio recordings.\nEvery episode ends with McLean's signature signoff, &quot;I'm Stuart McLean, so long for now,&quot; \n\nfollowed by the show's folksy guitar theme song, &quot;Happy Meeting In Glory&quot; (as performed by \n\nRy Cooder). The show is produced by Jess Milton. Meg Masters is the long-suffering story \n\neditor and the show's founding producer is Dave Amer.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9f1f92f3030b5a07b038063eda1905ad343c0f6","amp;dn":"Vinyl+Cafe+Stories+from+CBC+Radio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9f1f92f3030b5a07b038063eda1905ad343c0f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,241,249,47,48,48,181,160,123,3,128,99,237,161,144,90,211,67,192,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
