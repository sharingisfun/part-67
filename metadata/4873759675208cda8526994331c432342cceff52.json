The Northern Irishman likes his sides to play free-flowing football, as does Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, so today's game should be one to savour. The Gunners won this fixture 2-1 last season thanks to an injury-time Robin van Persie goal, and that victory proved crucial at they went on to qualify for the Champions League for the 15th consecutive season.\n\nElsewhere, Manchester United make the long trip south to face newly-promoted Southampton at the St Mary's Stadium. The Saints dropped out of the top flight in 2005 after losing to the Red Devils on the final day, and will feel they are long overdue revenge against Sir Alex Ferguson's men. The day's other game sees Newcastle host Aston Villa, a match they won last term thanks to Papiss Cisse's first goal for the club.\n\nColin and guests will also look back at the goals from yesterday's six matches.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4873759675208cda8526994331c432342cceff52","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+Two+02.09.2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4873759675208cda8526994331c432342cceff52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,115,117,150,117,32,140,218,133,38,153,67,49,196,50,52,44,206,255,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
