Now Jose wants to finally get clean, but he's terrified about what may happen when he goes through the process.\n\nThere has been no medically documented case of someone quitting steroids after using them for so long, and the doctors have different opinions about what Jose will go through physically and mentally.\n\nViewers watch Jose as he tries to end his long addiction, keep his girlfriend, and learn the shocking things steroid use has done to his body. He talks about regretting writing his tell-all book, the isolation he feels from baseball, and his financial troubles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e89e5e2a9f51f051473e3061690e93c2ba2242b1","amp;dn":"Jose+Canseco+-+Last+Shot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e89e5e2a9f51f051473e3061690e93c2ba2242b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,158,94,42,159,81,240,81,71,62,48,97,105,14,147,194,186,34,66,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
