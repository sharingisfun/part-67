Bruce Wayne (Batman) suffers burnout and is systematically assaulted and crippled by a &quot;super steroid&quot;-enhanced genius named Bane. Wayne is replaced as Batman by an apprentice named Jean-Paul Valley, who becomes increasingly violent and unstable, tarnishing Batman's reputation. Eventually, Wayne is healed through paranormal means, and reclaims his role as Batman.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d98000f8caadeacdfae27f04ec60a88fb0cf80c0","amp;dn":"Batman+Knightfall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d98000f8caadeacdfae27f04ec60a88fb0cf80c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,128,0,248,202,173,234,205,250,226,127,4,236,96,168,143,176,207,128,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
