Dressed as angels, they sit on the board of intelligent design looking over Earth's creation and comparing the colors of humans like swatches. &quot;White's a little bland,&quot; says one. She's worried that &quot;white&quot; people might feel inferior to the more colorful people. The sadistic pair goes on to assign the roles of which sex &quot;gets&quot; to give birth, and they heartily laugh at recompensing the men with oversized egos.\n\nThis is how Kathy Najimy and Mo Gaffney's Parallel Lives opens. A cult classic back in the Eighties, it begets sketch after sketch flavored with feminism Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the fight for which might seem somewhat nostalgic for Breanna Stogner and Kathleen Fletcher, two young women who grew up (or were born) in that time. But Kathy and Mo's portrayal of gender stereotypes and the nonaggressive satire in the writing still come off as fresh. The characters hit every age from schoolgirls to geriatrics. And in the City Theatre Company's production, Stogner's pistol-wheeling wit fits well with Fletcher's happy-go-lucky nuance, creating a bond between the two actresses that's less like Laurel and Hardy and more Kathy and Mo; they treat each other with affection...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c35fab296361e4dfa2d2d3d1d98730bbf65b3ec5","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Kathy+and+Mo+Show+%282+HBO+Comedy+Specials%29+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c35fab296361e4dfa2d2d3d1d98730bbf65b3ec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,95,171,41,99,97,228,223,162,210,211,209,217,135,48,187,246,91,62,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
