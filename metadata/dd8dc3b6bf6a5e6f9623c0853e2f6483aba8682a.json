OK, because I'm paranoid ... that doesn't mean we're not being watched.\nI don't do movies (MPAA) or music (RIAA), but I'm still not sure if it's safe.\nSo, I sacrifice any chance of &quot;trusted&quot; status on TPB.\nA small price to pay to offer something that has proven value.\nYou don't need to know me - you only need to know my work.\n\nI NEVER claim an x264 encoding credit. I GIVE proper credit where due.\nI toyed with the idea of replacing the file's moniker with &quot;CC2AVI&quot;.\nBut that would be wrong ... for me at least.\n\nMy offerings are clearly identifiable:\nuse search term &quot;MP4SUX&quot;\nuse search term &quot;x264.MP3*.avi&quot;\nWithout quotes for TPB.\nWith quotes for Google.\n\nTPB is very good at removing fakes - dozens comment and then it's removed.\nRemember, if you see &quot;it's a fake&quot; and it's not removed - it's NOT a fake.\nBut have some compassion - comments cannot be removed once made on TPB.\nYou should click on the handle of such comments and see if THEY offer anything.\nSo far (fingers crossed) I have had nothing removed from TPB.\n\nThis is MY labor of love.\nI make no money, I seek no credit &amp; I am NOT affiliated with anyone but you.\nAnonymous or not, I have a growing track record of doing my bit responsibly.\nCompetition and choice are my watchwords in cyberspace.\nAnything I can do - you can do better!\nI would love nothing more than for you to go into competition with me.\n\nMP4SUX\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd8dc3b6bf6a5e6f9623c0853e2f6483aba8682a","amp;dn":"Chelsea.Lately.2012.08.22.HDTV.x264.MP3-HULKSMASH.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd8dc3b6bf6a5e6f9623c0853e2f6483aba8682a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,141,195,182,191,106,94,111,150,35,192,133,62,47,100,131,171,168,104,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
