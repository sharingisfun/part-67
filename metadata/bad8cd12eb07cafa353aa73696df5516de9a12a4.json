The series concentrated on notorious murders carried out during the 20th century. \n\nIn the beginning of each show a particularly infamous crime would be examined as an example. The words Ã¢â‚¬Å“Infamous Murders now examinesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ would follow and the other three murders would be presented.\n\nThe series relied on historical documents for visuals rather than reenactments. Dramatic music was used to heighten the narration along with rostrum shots of photographs, and vintage television/film footage.\n\nEpisode Guide: \n\nAngels of Death - Nurses sometimes kill.\n\nCrimes of Prejudice - Deaths of civil-rights workers; political and ethnic killings; murders of gay men. \n\nCult Killings - Cult leaders exert huge power over members, sometimes causing them to kill or to commit suicide.\n\nDeadly Doctors - A doctor convicted of killing her daughter-in-law may be innocent; a doctor gets away with the murders of 132 patients; a British doctor may have killed as many as 1,000 female patients.\n\nDeadly Kidnappings - The Lindbergh baby's kidnapping and murder; confused kidnappers take the wrong person; a murderer abducts a young heiress. \n\nDeadly Ladies - Women sometimes kill. \n\nDeath in the Country - Even America's heartland is not immune to violent crime. \n\nEvading Justice - Several serial killers evade punishment. \n\nEvidence of Murder - Crucial evidence sometimes brings killers to justice years later. \n\nFinal Justice - Capital punishment. \n\nFrom Coast to Coast - Traveling murderers roam the country or the world in search of victims. \n\nGangland Murders - Prohibition-era gangsters fight for supremacy; bank robber John Dillinger becomes public enemy number one. \n\nHollywood Murders - A suicide note accompanies the death of a movie producer; in 1935 a screen idol becomes an apparent suicide; in 1958 a teenage daughter is charged with the murder of an actress's boyfriend. \n\nHorror on the Highways - The anonymity of the highway and the speed of its traffic make it an ideal dumping ground for murderers.
