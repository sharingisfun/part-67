The film stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and Hugo Weaving, and was first released in the United States on March 31, 1999. The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels, and the Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games, and animated short films.\nThe film depicts a future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality or cyberspace created by sentient machines to pacify and subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Upon learning this, computer programmer &quot;Neo&quot; is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, involving other people who have been freed from the &quot;dream world&quot; and into reality.\nThe film contains many references to the cyberpunk and hacker subcultures; philosophical and religious ideas such as RenÃƒÂ© Descartes' evil genius, the Allegory of the Cave, the brain-in-a-vat thought experiment; and homages to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Metropolis, Hong Kong action cinema, spaghetti westerns, dystopian fiction, M. C. Escher's work, and Japanese animation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6822ff474482e6b07ee1f3353eb60628341d2bba","amp;dn":"The+Matrix+-+UK+-+PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6822ff474482e6b07ee1f3353eb60628341d2bba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,34,255,71,68,130,230,176,126,225,243,53,62,182,6,40,52,29,43,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
