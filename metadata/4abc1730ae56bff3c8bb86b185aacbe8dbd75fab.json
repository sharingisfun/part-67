Advances in technology and bio-engineering turned people into metahumans and metahumans into gods. But where there are heroes, there must also be villains. Eventually, as people began to take advantage of the mega-tech for personal gain, the technology was banned. Superheroes thus became outlaws, and actual real outlaws went underground.\n\nTo most people, Los Angeles-based Aggressive Solutions Int., or A.S.I., appears to be a mere public relations firm or trouble-shooting agency, but in reality it is a front for a gang of powerful villains. All was going well for A.S.I. until it found itself the target of a relentless and violent vendetta by a mysterious woman calling herself Madame Mirage.\n\nThis is my first time uploading a multi file torrent. If it goes off without a hitch I will be surprised.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4abc1730ae56bff3c8bb86b185aacbe8dbd75fab","amp;dn":"Madame+Mirage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4abc1730ae56bff3c8bb86b185aacbe8dbd75fab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,188,23,48,174,86,191,243,200,187,134,177,133,170,203,232,219,215,95,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
