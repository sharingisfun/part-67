From death stars to ringed planets, star clusters to space wars, THE UNIVERSE uses new discoveries and more advanced CGI to help explain the mysteries of outer space. From wormholes to transporters, examine which elements from popular sci-fi movies could really exist; and discover how the universe is awash in all sorts of strange liquids, from oceans of methane to blobs of alcohol floating in space, and even iron rain. Watch and marvel as experts cook up ten ways to destroy the Earth, including blowing it up with anti-matter, hurling it into the Sun, and colliding with another galaxy.\n&quot;I have uploaded Series 4; it's the only Series of The Universe that is missing on MVGroup and I have had over the past year quite a lot of requests for it&quot; cheers Harry\n\n\n\n\n11)  Science Fiction Science Fact \nWarp speed, transporters, wormholes and lasers--they are all staples of science fiction books, movies, and TV shows. But the fantastic world of tomorrow is quickly becoming the futuristic world of today. While you may not be &quot;beaming&quot; to your next appointment any time soon, researchers are preparing for the first tests of a present-day &quot;transporter.&quot; And while scientists have long mocked Hollywood's visions of warp speed and faster-than-light travel as prohibited by Einstein's laws, a new generation of physicists continues to rewrite the fundamental rules of the universe. Is there a way around the cosmic speed limit? Maybe... as long as you're prepared to survive a journey through the ultra-high energies of one of the most violent places in the cosmos--the heart of a twisting, swirling vortex that leads either to strange, new worlds... or certain death.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img857.imageshack.us/img857/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img857.imageshack.us/img857/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img36.imageshack.us/img36/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img36.imageshack.us/img36/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img171.imageshack.us/img171/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img171.imageshack.us/img171/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1874 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 45.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 12\n * Part Size: 640 MB\n * Source : DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.history.com/shows/the-universe/interactives/facts-about-the-universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.history.com/shows/the-universe/interactives/facts-about-the-universe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9b82a1d94d42ba2142af9905fb3ee309bf69c29","amp;dn":"History+Ch+The+Universe+Season+4+11of12+Science+Fiction+Science+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9b82a1d94d42ba2142af9905fb3ee309bf69c29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,184,42,29,148,212,43,162,20,42,249,144,95,179,238,48,155,246,156,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
