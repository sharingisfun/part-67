Known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Terrifying Trio,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Linnea Quigley (The Return of the Living Dead), Brinke Stevens (The Slumber Party Massacre) and Michelle Bauer (The Tomb), headlined upwards of ten films per year, fending off men in rubber monster suits, pubescent teenage boys, and deadly showers. They joined together in campy cult films like Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-Rama (1988) and Nightmare Sisters (1987). They traveled all over the world, met President Reagan, and built mini-empires of trading cards, comic books, and model kits. Then it all came crashing down. This documentary remembers these actresses Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and their most common collaborators Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on how smart they were to play stupid. \n\nGenre: Documentary | Horror \nIMDB Rating: 7.3/10 \nDirected by: Jason Paul Collum \nStarring: Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Michelle Bauer \n\nRelease Name: \nScreaming.In.High.Heels.The.Rise.And.Fall.Of.The.Scream.Queen.Era.2011.DVDSCR.AC3-2.0.XviD-AXED \nSize: 1.68 GB \nVideo: x264, 720Ãƒâ€”400, 3597 Kbps \nAudio: English, AC3, 192 Kbps \nRuntime: 1h 3mn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:216933c2dbf11f209ebba15f7f6cb4f4d5b85817","amp;dn":"Screaming.In.High.HeelsThe.Rise.And.Fall.Of.The.Scream.Queen.Era","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"216933c2dbf11f209ebba15f7f6cb4f4d5b85817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,105,51,194,219,241,31,32,158,187,161,95,127,108,180,244,213,184,88,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
