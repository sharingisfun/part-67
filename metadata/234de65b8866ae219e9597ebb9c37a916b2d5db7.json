Great Jumping-On Point For New Readers! Ten years after the events of last issue, the world has changed - humans seemingly have learned their place, and the utopia that Voice Alaya sought for her people has seemingly arrived at last. Or has it? Rumbles of a revolution begin to shake through ape society, but for once, it isn't human! Writer Daryl Gregory and artist Carlos Magno continue their critically acclaimed run and kick off a new year of ape mayhem!\n\n\nThanks goes to ZeroDaze and theProletariat for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:234de65b8866ae219e9597ebb9c37a916b2d5db7","amp;dn":"Planet+of+the+Apes+13+%282+covers%29+%28theRevolutionaries-DCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"234de65b8866ae219e9597ebb9c37a916b2d5db7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,77,230,91,136,102,174,33,158,149,151,235,185,195,122,145,107,45,93,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
