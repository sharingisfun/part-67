Ã‚ÂµTorrent was designed to use as little cpu, space and memory as possible while offering all the functionalites expected from advanced clients. With BitTorrent, you can download files faster and contribute by sharing files and bandwidth. Most of the features present in other BitTorrent clients are present in Ã‚ÂµTorrent, including bandwidth prioritization, scheduling, RSS auto-downloading and Mainline DHT (compatible with BitComet). Additionally, Ã‚ÂµTorrent supports the Protocol Encryption joint specification (compatible with Azureus 2.4.0.0 and above, BitComet 0.63 and above) and peer exchange. Ã‚ÂµTorrent was written with efficiency in mind. Unlike many torrent clients, it does not hog valuable system resources Ã¢â‚¬â€œ typically using less than 6MB of memory, allowing you to use the computer as if it werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t there at all. Additionally, the program itself is contained within a single executable less than 1 MB in size.\nVarious icon, toolbar graphic and status icon replacements are available, and creating your own is very simple. Ã‚ÂµTorrent also has support for localization, and with a language file present, will automatically switch to your system language. If your language isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t available, you can easily add your own, or edit other existing translations to improve them!\n\n\n                                  By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20810a66080f062d4fd3bb69a6896c69f73eb1df","amp;dn":"uTorrent+3.2+Final+%2B+3.2.1+Beta+%2B+3.3+Alpha+Final%5BWindows%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20810a66080f062d4fd3bb69a6896c69f73eb1df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,129,10,102,8,15,6,45,79,211,187,105,166,137,108,105,247,62,177,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
