So hold your nose, kiss the babies, and just think how good you would look on a stamp.\n\nNow, before we go into your media responsibilities, you must understand the true history of political power, so you don't accidentally act on the naive idealism you are required to project to the general public.\n\nThe reality of political power is very simple: bad farmers own crops and livestock -- good farmers own human beings...\n\n---\n\nA free book by Stefan Molyneux, host of Freedomain Radio, the largest and most popular philosophy show on the web -- http://www.freedomainradio.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78faba049643be96851cc54bf71d88a7902d02a3","amp;dn":"The+Handbook+of+Human+Ownership","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78faba049643be96851cc54bf71d88a7902d02a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,250,186,4,150,67,190,150,133,28,197,75,247,29,136,167,144,45,2,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
