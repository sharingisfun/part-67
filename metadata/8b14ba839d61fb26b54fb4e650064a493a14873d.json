Its state of the art filter creates effects from Van Gogh's painterly style to the harsh and gritty film noir look of Frank Miller.\n\nFeatures:\n\n    Eight photo layouts.\n    A highly customizable filter that lets you achieve a range of creative effects such as graphic novel, woodcut, pencil and oil-painting.\n    Customizable caption for each panel in the layout.\n    A gallery for viewing your stylized images.\n    New features and improvements are in the works so keep watching this space!\n\nAs always we love to hear what our users think. Please feel free to contact us with ideas and comments. We value your feedback!\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Sep 4, 2012)\n\n    Increased allowable memory heap for users on honeycomb, ice-cream sandwich and jellybean. This should alleviate out of memory issues experienced by a couple of users loading in large images.\n    Users who have &quot;forced GPU rendering for 2d drawing&quot; option enabled should now be able to see pictures on the canvas. Thanks to Rob and Jamesy for tracking that one down!\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.2+\n\n\n                                   By bobiras2009\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b14ba839d61fb26b54fb4e650064a493a14873d","amp;dn":"Lithic+v1.4+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b14ba839d61fb26b54fb4e650064a493a14873d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,20,186,131,157,97,251,38,181,79,180,230,80,6,74,73,58,20,135,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
