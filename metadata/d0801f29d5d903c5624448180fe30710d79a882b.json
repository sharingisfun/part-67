Until now, Katie has enjoyed life and all its pleasures without thinking too much about it. But, as she speaks to the camera, she reflects upon the men in her life and wonders if she has made all the right romantic decisions. There is Bobby (Rufus Sewell), her charming Scottish boyfriend, who has a propensity for slipping off to the bathroom for a heroin fix. And then there is Jack (Patrick Ryecart), another lover, whose sad-eyed demeanor belies his lack of sexual excitement. So what should Katie do about her beaux, particularly when she is preparing to move to New York? \n\nDirector: Don Boyd\n\nCast: Patsy Kensit, Jack Shepherd, Patrick Ryecart, Maynard Eziashi, Rufus Sewell\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103143/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103143/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n***Thanks to IndyB007 at cinemageddon.net***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0801f29d5d903c5624448180fe30710d79a882b","amp;dn":"Twenty-One+%281991%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0801f29d5d903c5624448180fe30710d79a882b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,128,31,41,213,217,3,197,98,68,72,24,15,227,7,16,215,154,136,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
