Before the country goes totally off the rails - and before the Constitution is completely shredded - George Washington has sent his top team back to DC to address high gas prices, our rising debt, healthcare, Government abuse, corruption, border security, defense, Islam, class warfare and much more. For one week John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison will visit each evening with the President.
