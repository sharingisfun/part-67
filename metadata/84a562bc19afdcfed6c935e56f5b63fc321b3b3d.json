And not just Jimi Hendrix or Sir Mix-A-Lot, either. The Emerald City was home to a thriving soul scene in the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s, and this documentary digs up exquisite odds and ends from a rich musical past largely eclipsed and forgotten by the booming Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s. It was Seattle DJ Mr. Supreme who stumbled on local soul and funk masterpieces in Goodwills and record shops, only to find that many of the once-celebrated artists heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d discoveredÃ¢â‚¬â€players from funky, outrageous acts like Black On White Affair, CookinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Bag, and Cold, Bold TogetherÃ¢â‚¬â€were living in obscurity around him. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the incredibly funky tracks from those bands that make up the, ahem, soul of WheedleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Groove. Between archival audio and exhaustive interviews, the film plays out kind of like a Pacific Northwest version of Wim WendersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Buena Vista Social Club. The documentary isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just an eye-opener for regional musicheads or vindication for these bands, who almost unilaterally disbanded when disco DJs took over the clubs and airwaves; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also more proof that one doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to work for Smithsonian Folkways to uncover important pieces of music history. Pop giveth and pop taketh away, but these artists are finally gaining national exposure three or four decades after their heyday\n\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFormat version                           : Version 2\nFile size                                : 1.04 GiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 28mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 691 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf52.13.0\nWriting library                          : Lavf52.13.0\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\n\n\nyodie1997 the original    hope you enjoy the  music\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tribler.org/trac&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tribler.org/trac&lt;/a&gt;    TRIBLER CHANNEL  yodie1997  FUNK JAZZ  COLLECTIONS LTD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84a562bc19afdcfed6c935e56f5b63fc321b3b3d","amp;dn":"Wheedles.Groove+-+70%2Cs+Seattle+soul+music+scene.2009.DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84a562bc19afdcfed6c935e56f5b63fc321b3b3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,165,98,188,25,175,220,254,214,201,53,229,111,91,99,252,50,27,59,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
