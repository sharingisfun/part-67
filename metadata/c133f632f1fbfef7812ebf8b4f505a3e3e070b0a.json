It's a book that will be treasured and shared by every teacher in America-and everyone who's ever loved or learned from one","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c133f632f1fbfef7812ebf8b4f505a3e3e070b0a","amp;dn":"What+Teachers+Make+-+Taylor+Mali","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c133f632f1fbfef7812ebf8b4f505a3e3e070b0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,51,246,50,241,251,254,247,129,46,191,139,79,80,90,62,62,7,11,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
