It premiered on Sunday, 24 June 2012 on Jade and HD Jade, the first TVB drama to broadcast in the Sunday night time slot since 1995's File of Justice. Produced by TVB under executive producer Lam Chi-wah, Tiger Cubs is one of six TVB dramas that were promoted at the 2011 Hong Kong Internal Film and TV Market. Tiger Cubs debuted its trailer at TVB's Programme Presentation 2012 event on 1 November 2011.\n\nManila hostage crisis dramatisation\n\nThe production of Tiger Cubs was announced shortly after the Manila hostage crisis, causing the media to speculate if the incident had inspired the production of Tiger Cubs. Producer Lam Chi-wah denied the claims, saying that he had intentions to produce a drama about the SDU even before the crisis happened.\n\nOn 30 March 2011, a tourist bus hostage scene inspired by the Manila hostage crisis was filming near Kai Tak Airport. The actors involved in the shoot admitted afterwards that they rather not have filmed it, and guest star Kenneth Ma, who portrays the hijacker, said he was afraid the scene would tarnish his public image.\n\nAlso known as \tSpecial Duties Unit\nGenre \tPolice procedural\nAction\nDrama\nWritten by \tLee Yee-wah\nDirected by \tHung Kam-fat\nWong Kwok-fai\nChan San-hap\nStarring \tJoe Ma\nJessica Hsuan\nHim Law\nOscar Leung\nVincent Wong\nMandy Wong\nChristine Kuo\nBenjamin Yuen\nWilliam Chak\nPatrick Tang\nDominic Lam\n\n=====================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb14bbef24611e61e0221e5d2c71f0c747c7a021","amp;dn":"Tiger.Cubs.HK-TVB.mini.serires.13episodes.RMVB.HDTV+%E9%A3%9B%E8%99%8E%E7%B5%82%E6%A5%B5%E4%BB%BB%E5%8B%99+%E5%85%A8%E9%9B%86","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb14bbef24611e61e0221e5d2c71f0c747c7a021","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,20,187,239,36,97,30,97,224,34,30,93,44,113,240,199,71,199,160,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
