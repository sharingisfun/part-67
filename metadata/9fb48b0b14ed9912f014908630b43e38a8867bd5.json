The blow-by-blow narrative of the assault, beginning with the helicopter crash that could have ended OwenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life straight through to the radio call confirming Bin LadenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, is an essential piece of modern history.\n\nIn No Easy Day, Owen also takes readers onto the field of battle in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ongoing War on Terror and details the selection and training process for one of the most elite units in the military. OwenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story draws on his youth in Alaska and describes the SEALsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ quest to challenge themselves at the highest levels of physical and mental endurance. With boots-on-the-ground detail, Owen describes numerous previously unreported missions that illustrate the life and work of a SEAL and the evolution of the team after the events of September 11. In telling the true story of the SEALs whose talents, skills, experiences, and exceptional sacrifices led to one of the greatest victories in the War on Terror, Mark Owen honors the men who risk everything for our country, and he leaves readers with a deep understanding of the warriors who keep America safe.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 336 pages\n# Publisher: Dutton Adult; First Edition/First Printing edition (September 4, 2012)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0525953728\n# ISBN-13: 978-0525953722","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fb48b0b14ed9912f014908630b43e38a8867bd5","amp;dn":"No+Easy+Day%2CThe+Firsthand+Account+of+killing+Osama+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fb48b0b14ed9912f014908630b43e38a8867bd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,180,139,11,20,237,153,18,240,20,144,134,48,180,62,56,168,134,123,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
