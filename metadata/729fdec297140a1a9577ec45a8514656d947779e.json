Also ICS has no 3D drawer because it does not contain the &quot;old&quot; opengl interface. But as it is natively accelerated anyway, 2D drawer should be fast.\n\nMake no mistake, this is the fastest launcher you'll ever run. Small, light, configurable. The Gingerbread launcher as it should have been.\nNow including configurable homsecreen grid from 4x4 to 6x6, resizeable widgets, and, never seen in any launcher: control over core Android window animation speed.\n\nNo useless stuff, no compromises. Performance and usability are the driving forces here.\n\nFeature:\n\n    Based on Gingerbread Launcher2 source code tweaked for extreme speed\n    Fully accelerated 3D Waterfall app drawer\n    Normal 2D app drawer\n    Choice between 3 and 5 icon Dock\n    Configurable support for launcher auto-rotation\n    Configurable number of homescreens: from 1 to 9\n    Configurable default homescreen\n    Configurable transition speed of homescreens\n    Configurable bounce effect on homescreen transitions\n    Configurable Homescreen grid: From 4 to 6 rows, and 4 to 6 columns (must restart FTL for changes to take effect!)\n    Hide/show icon titles on homescreen shortcuts\n    Configurable Dock icons size\n    Configurable infinite looping of homescreens\n    Configurable wallpaper scrolling\n    Configurable support for scrollable widgets\n    Swipe to action: Configurable &quot;swipe up&quot; to open drawer\n    Swipe to action: Configurable &quot;swipe down&quot; to pull notification bar\n    Includes anim speed: precise control over core Android windows/transition animation speed\n    Configurable support for resizeable widgets: only when adding them to the homescreen, you cannot edit them later.\n\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Sep 3, 2012)\n\n    Android Jellybean 4.1.1 Compatibility\n    Small optimizations\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.1+\n\n\n                                   By bobiras2009\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:729fdec297140a1a9577ec45a8514656d947779e","amp;dn":"FTL+Launcher+Pro+v3.1.3+Final+By+bobiras200","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"729fdec297140a1a9577ec45a8514656d947779e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,159,222,194,151,20,10,26,149,119,236,69,168,81,70,86,217,71,119,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
