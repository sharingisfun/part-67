I fell short of that goal back in 2011, having only shared 964 releases for 2011, combined over 36 different torrent bundles.  But in part that's probably because I got a late start doing it from September '11 through to December '11.\n\nThis year I started in February '12, and including this 29th torrent today, we now have 762 christian releases to sample for 2012.  I would like to thank everyone who continues to share this music today, long after it's seeded and I've moved onto the next bundle.\n\nThe 25 new titles in this 29th bundle includes...\n\n * Anchor And Braille - 2012 - The Quiet Life\n * Attaboy - 2012 - Ambient Love EP\n * Chris Sligh - 2012 - For Our God And King\n * Derek Webb - 2012 - Ctrl\n * Dustin Smith - 2012 - You Are The Fire\n * Gateway Worship - 2012 - In Jesus' Name\n * J Moss - 2012 - V4 - The Other Side\n * JDR - 2012 - This Is JDR\n * JGivens - 2012 - #occupyMondays\n * Linda Randle - 2012 - Til The Storm Passes By\n * Long Live The King - 2012 - Transient\n * Naomi Ruth - 2012 - When Were 83 - Single\n * Philmont - 2012 - Rearranged And Unplugged EP\n * Project 86 - 2012 - Wait For The Siren\n * Radiance Effect, The - 2012 - Breakdown\n * Rhonda Vincent - 2012 - Sunday Mornin' Singin'\n * Richard Marx - 2012 - A Night Out With Friends\n * Sean Feucht - 2012 - Songs For Nations\n * Sixpence None The Richer - 2012 - Lost in Transition\n * Son Lux - 2012 - BreakThru Radio Session\n * Thera - 2012 - From The North\n * Tourniquet - 2012 - Antiseptic Bloodbath\n * Tragic Hero - 2012 - Going Home\n * United Night Of Worship - 2012 - Love Lifted - Single\n * Wayfarer - 2012 - The River\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - August 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a06863623e3d0218a779470fc80d3fa323d2633e","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+29+of+29%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a06863623e3d0218a779470fc80d3fa323d2633e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,104,99,98,62,61,2,24,167,121,71,15,200,13,63,163,35,210,99,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
