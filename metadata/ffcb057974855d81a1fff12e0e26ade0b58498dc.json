Eight years later, the actor is back as Frank Castle in the short film The Punsher: Dirty Laundry, that made its debut Saturday night at San Diego Comic-Con. It also stars Ron Perlman, and was directed by Phil Joanou. \n\n&quot;I wanted to make a fan film for a character I've always loved and believed in - a love letter to Frank Castle &amp; his fans. It was an incredible experience with everyone on the project throwing in their time just for the fun of it. It's been a blast to be a part of from start to finish -- we hope the friends of Frank enjoy watching it as much as we did making it.&quot; -- Thomas Jane","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffcb057974855d81a1fff12e0e26ade0b58498dc","amp;dn":"The+Punisher+-+Dirty+Laundry+%282012%29+-+Short+Film+-+JRED.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffcb057974855d81a1fff12e0e26ade0b58498dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,203,5,121,116,133,93,129,161,255,241,46,14,38,173,224,181,132,152,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
