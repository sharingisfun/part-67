It can, of course, make a straight copy, or &quot;clone&quot; -- useful when you want to move all your data from one machine to another, or do a simple backup. In moments, you can completely duplicate your boot drive to another drive, partition, or image file.\n\nClones for safety. To ensure you can safely roll back a system after the unexpected occurs. With a few clicks, you can easily &quot;checkpoint&quot; your system, preserving your computer's critical applications and files while you run on a working, bootable copy. If anything goes wrong, just reboot to the original. When you do, your current Documents, Music, Pictures -- even iSync data -- are available! You can get back to work immediately.\n\nClones for industry! SuperDuper has enough features to satisfy the advanced user, too. Its simple-but-powerful Copy Script feature allows complete control of exactly what files get copied, ignored, even aliased (&quot;soft linked&quot; for the Unix inclined) from one drive to another.\n\nWhat's New\nVersion 2.7:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Mountain Lion compatibility\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Gatekeeper support - signed application\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Copy speed improvements\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Mid-file-copy status updates to improve user-level feedback\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ &quot;Vanishing files&quot; no longer trigger directory error detection\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Both App Store and non-App Store versions of Growl are supported (tested up to v1.4); Notification Center supported through Growl\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Local snapshots (.MobileBackups) no longer copied to backup (they are in an un-copyable state too often)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Send to Shirt Pocket email address improvements\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New applications introduced in Mountain Lion are copied when using the Sandbox - shared users and applications copy script\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Yet even better handling of 'dead' and 'bad' mount points on startup\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Better handling of 'dead' and 'bad' mount points on startup\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Improvements made when copying highly active files\n\n\nRequirements\nPPC / Intel, Mac OS X 10.4 or later \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eb9d2c2fbf0b05d718b3ad1ce807c9086ca68db","amp;dn":"SuperDuper+2.7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eb9d2c2fbf0b05d718b3ad1ce807c9086ca68db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,185,210,194,251,240,176,93,113,139,58,209,206,128,124,144,134,202,104,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
