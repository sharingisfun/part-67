He presents many fascinating and unexpected cases in detail. Like slave rebellions, these massacres are doomed, gory, sometimes even inadvertently comic, and grossly misunderstood. Taking up where Bowling for Columbine left off, this book seeks to set these murders in their proper context and thereby reveal their meaning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ba3c59769ee341abe00eaae32c083d4888b427","amp;dn":"Going+Postal+%3A+Rage+Murder+and+Rebellion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ba3c59769ee341abe00eaae32c083d4888b427","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,186,60,89,118,158,227,65,171,224,14,170,227,44,8,61,72,136,180,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
