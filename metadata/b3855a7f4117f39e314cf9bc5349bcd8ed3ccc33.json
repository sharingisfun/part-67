In Kuala Lumpur, Man stays with his village friend, Salim, who teaches him a lot about city life. It is through Salim that Man meets Nadia, an ex model. However, Man fails to see that Nadia is only looking for a boy toy to buy her expensive gifts. Eventually Man's assets run dry and he is forced to work odd jobs in order to fund his living.
