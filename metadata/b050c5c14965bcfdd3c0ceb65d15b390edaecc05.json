Being a self-contained unit with an under-slung diesel engine it has no need for a separate locomotive and is therefore economical in operation.\n\nFeaturing unique and exclusive Just Trains developed ActivScript features such as operating destination blinds and operational DRA (Drivers Reminder Appliance) this high quality rendition of the Class 153 DMU is the one to drive!\n\nFirst introduced in 1991, these distinctive units have a driver's cab at each end to allow the driver to change ends and drive in the opposite direction without the need to turn the unit around. The 153 DMU features gangway door connections that allow persons to walk between the units whilst they are moving when two units are coupled together.\n\nThis Class 153 DMU Advanced add-on is the second release in our Advanced range that provides many realistic and accurate operations exclusive to Just Trains. Thanks to ActivScript technology, the Advanced range provides immersive features such as advanced operating controls, realistic systems and authentic sounds.\n\nPlease enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b050c5c14965bcfdd3c0ceb65d15b390edaecc05","amp;dn":"Railworks+3+Class+153+DMU+ADVANCED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b050c5c14965bcfdd3c0ceb65d15b390edaecc05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,80,197,193,73,101,188,253,211,192,206,182,93,21,179,144,237,174,204,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
