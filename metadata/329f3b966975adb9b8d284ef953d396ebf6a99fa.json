Emilia tells her family that all of them are making the trip. Her two daughters, their husbands and children, one great-grandchild, and one child's friend jam into a camper van atop an old Chevy pickup. They leave from Buenos Aires. Engine trouble, a toothache, a stray dog, mosquitoes, and the heat complicate the journey. Cousins kiss, a melancholy brother-in-law tries to re-kindle an old flame, and the infant's father shows up uninvited. The screen is full of close ups. &quot;Well, that's life,&quot; says Emilia.\n\n\nSubtitles srt : Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:329f3b966975adb9b8d284ef953d396ebf6a99fa","amp;dn":"Familia+Rodante+aka+Rolling+Family+2004+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"329f3b966975adb9b8d284ef953d396ebf6a99fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,159,59,150,105,117,173,185,184,210,132,239,149,61,57,110,191,106,153,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
