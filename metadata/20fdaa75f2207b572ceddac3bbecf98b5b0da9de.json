A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the relief effort in Japan. Q&amp;A Includes: What are the actual radiation levels in Japan? Can I shift to a reality where the Japan disaster has not happened? Are UFOs seen in Japan helping the radiation situation? Did the Japan disaster happen as a result of the &quot;bad karma&quot; of whaling? What are some other ways to solve the energy crisis and replace nuclear energy? How can I improve lucid dreaming? How can I find my true love? Will eating certain foods raise my vibration? Does there really have to be a limit to a physical lifetime? Is protest positive? A new perspective on animal suffering.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bashar.org/store.html#hurricane&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bashar.org/store.html#hurricane&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20fdaa75f2207b572ceddac3bbecf98b5b0da9de","amp;dn":"Bashar+-+A+Message+for+Japan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20fdaa75f2207b572ceddac3bbecf98b5b0da9de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,253,170,117,242,32,123,87,44,237,218,195,187,236,249,139,91,13,169,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
