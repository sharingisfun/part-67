It was developed by German indie developer NG:DEV.TEAM in 2006.[1] While the Neo Geo version was self-published, the Dreamcast version was released by redspotgames in January 2007, as an unlicensed title.[2] In 2009 The Dreamcast version received a reprint in the form of a Directors Cut called Last Hope Pink Bullets.

This edition features improved on screen visibility in comparison to its 1st print due to pink bullets etc. That and various other features make the game easier to allow a more accessible gameplay experience with emphasis on scoring.[5]\nUnlike the previous release Last Hope Pink Bullets came in a Pink DVD Case instead of a Jewel Japanese Style Dreamcast casing.\n\nSome of the changes are:\nInstant respawn\nPermanent rotary protection unit\nHigher ship speed from beginning\nReduced difficulty\nChanges in background and bullet colors for higher visibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis game is still pretty damn hard but still a well-made r-type ummmmm type of game. So glad the Dreamcast is still kicking after all these years.\n\nI use Alcohol 120 to burn CDI files and it works perfectly.\nPlease seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb95034e14baf06000431330de3f330a76ed0df8","amp;dn":"Last+Hope+Pink+Bullets.cdi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb95034e14baf06000431330de3f330a76ed0df8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,149,3,78,20,186,240,96,0,67,19,48,222,63,51,10,118,237,13,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
