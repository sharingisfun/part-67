This film challenges that mindset by uncovering its role in our culture and exploring the social history of the toilet in Britain and abroad - as well as exploring many of our cultural toilet taboos. Starting in Merida, Spain with some of the the earliest surviving Roman toilets, we journey around the world - from the UK to China, Japan and Bangladesh - visiting toilets, ranging from the historically significant to the beautiful, from the functional and sometimes not-so-functional to the downright bizarre. Leading the journey is Everyman figure, Welsh poet and presenter Ifor ap Glyn, who has a passionate interest in the toilet, its history and how it has evolved over the centuries, right up to the development of the current design. Finally, there's a glimpse of the future and a possible solution to the global sanitation issues we now face.\n\n\nFormat            : AVI at 1 143 Kbps\nLength            : 482 MiB for 59mn 0s 560ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 005 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.774) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a9cb474fb8fbdc2b961d14e05ce0cbcf68bcc08","amp;dn":"The+Toilet++-+An+Unspoken+History+%282012+BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a9cb474fb8fbdc2b961d14e05ce0cbcf68bcc08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,156,180,116,251,143,189,194,185,97,209,78,5,206,12,188,246,139,204,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
