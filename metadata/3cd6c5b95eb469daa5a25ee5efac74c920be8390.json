Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cd6c5b95eb469daa5a25ee5efac74c920be8390","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+20+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cd6c5b95eb469daa5a25ee5efac74c920be8390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,214,197,185,94,180,105,218,165,162,94,229,239,172,116,201,32,190,131,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
