Byzantium Linux is designed to run on any x86 computer with at least one 802.11 a/b/g/n wireless interface.  Byzantium can be burned to a CD- or DVD-ROM (the .iso image is around 460 megabytes in size), booted from an external hard drive, or can even be installed in parallel with an existing operating system without risk to the user's data and software.  Byzantium Linux will act as a node of the mesh and will automatically connect to other mesh nodes and act as an access point for wifi-enabled mobile devices.\nTHIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE!  Do NOT expect Byzantium to be perfect.  Some features are not ready yet, others need work.  Things are going to break in weird ways and we need to know what those ways are so we can fix them.  Please, for the love of LOLcats, do not deploy Byzantium in situations where lives are at stake.\nFEATURES:\n- Binary compatible with Slackware-CURRENT.  Existing Slackware packages can be converted with a single command.\n- Can act as a gateway to the Internet if a link is available (via Ethernet or tethered smartphone).\n- Linux kernel v3.1.8\n- Drivers for dozens of wireless chipsets\n- KDE Trinity v3.5.12\n- LXDE (2010 release of all components)\n- Mplayer\n- GCC v4.5.2\n- Perl v5.12.3\n- Python v2.6.6\n- Firefox v4.0.1\n- X.org\n- Custom web-based control panel\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (to use)\n- Minimum of 1GB of RAM (512MB without copy2ram boot option)\n- i586 CPU or better\n- CD- or DVD-ROM drive\n- BIOS must boot removable media\n- At least one (1) 802.11 a/b/g/n interface\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (for persistent changes)\n- The above requirements to use Byzantium\n- 2+GB of free space on thumbdrive or harddrive\n\nHomepage: http://project-byzantium.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:343280df234fdff44fca9509163b5fdce2890a84","amp;dn":"Byzantium+Linux+v0.2a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"343280df234fdff44fca9509163b5fdce2890a84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,50,128,223,35,79,223,244,79,202,149,9,22,59,95,220,226,137,10,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
