So I kept researching and finally achieved 2 programs that actually worked (according to this post:)\n\nThese were the programs:\n-TVersity\n-Mezzmo\n\nI 1st ran a search trough the piratebay's torrent list but found nothing, so had to google and ran across some not so nice downloads (virus).\n\nI'm not 100% sure this download is virus free but my BitDefender detected nothing, and, to be sure, I ran it into a free file virus check program that I found:\n\n\nAfter I tested the program, I have to admit that it is a very user friendly GUI and easy to use services. And it also has no problem showing up on my TV's list.\n\nI has a transcode service that is actived whenever the device you're using cannot display the file (for example, it transcoded a .mkv I had to run in my TV). It also carries an option to set the CPU priority, enabling you to do other stuff while your movies gets transcoded.\n\nI later googled TVersity vs Mezzmo but the results were inconclusive and I just kept myself to Mezzmo.\n\nOverall I think it's a great program and &quot;deserves&quot; a virus free torrent in Piratebay!\n\n---\n[b]END OF REVIEW AND TOUGHS[/b]\n---\n\nWebsite: http://www.conceiva.com/products/mezzmo/default.asp\n\n---\n\nScreenshots (take from the website):\n\n\n[img]http://www.conceiva.com/products/mezzmo/images/screenshot1-thumb.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://www.conceiva.com/products/mezzmo/images/screenshot5-thumb.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://www.conceiva.com/products/mezzmo/images/screenshot4-thumb.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://www.conceiva.com/products/mezzmo/images/screenshot8-thumb.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://www.conceiva.com/products/mezzmo/images/screenshot3-thumb.jpg[/img]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fefa5f7f52af58e5acf032c3258076616ba0e3a2","amp;dn":"Mezzmo+2.4.3.+DJiNN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fefa5f7f52af58e5acf032c3258076616ba0e3a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,250,95,127,82,175,88,229,172,240,50,195,37,128,118,97,107,160,227,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
