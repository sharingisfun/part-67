If you want to make them into a pdf file and reupload, GO FOR IT! :D\n\n-A Quick Note About the Computones Volumes- \nThere were a lot of repeated pages (mostly technical/troubleshooting stuff) throughout this series. \nAny pages that were included in a previous volume have been omitted (to save on scanning/editing time). \nSo, make sure to grab the first volume if you want to look through that stuff. \nAlso: I was able to get the Computones software to work with GIMP 2.6 using the PSPI plugin. Haven't tried with the latest versions though. \nI remember trying to get it to work in Photoshop CS5 and it didn't work--so your best bet is GIMP or an earlier, supported version of Photoshop. \n\n\nBook Description:\n\nCharacters as couples and scenes of couples appear frequently in manga. Using tone to add effects to the panel can completely change the mood projected. Tone works well with figures as well as in the background. Try using a variety of tones to achieve your own, unique touch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f80baf8ef4966985035062874d5d08f3fe4431d","amp;dn":"Computones+Vol.+4+-+Portraying+Couples","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f80baf8ef4966985035062874d5d08f3fe4431d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,128,186,248,239,73,102,152,80,53,6,40,116,213,208,143,63,228,67,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
