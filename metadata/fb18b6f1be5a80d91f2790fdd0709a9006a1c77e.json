Why do we listen to advice just because it came from someone Ã¢â‚¬Å“importantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? Why are we more likely to fall in love when thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s danger involved? In Sway, renowned organizational thinker Ori Brafman and his brother, psychologist Rom Brafman, answer all these questions and more.\n\nDrawing on cutting-edge research from the fields of social psychology, behavioral economics, and organizational behavior, Sway reveals dynamic forces that influence every aspect of our personal and business lives, including loss aversion (our tendency to go to great lengths to avoid perceived losses), the diagnosis bias (our inability to reevaluate our initial diagnosis of a person or situation), and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“chameleon effectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (our tendency to take on characteristics that have been arbitrarily assigned to us). \n\nSway introduces us to the Harvard Business School professor who got his students to pay $204 for a $20 bill, the head of airline safety whose disregard for his years of training led to the transformation of an entire industry, and the football coach who turned conventional strategy on its head to lead his team to victory. We also learn the curse of the NBA draft, discover why interviews are a terrible way to gauge future job performance, and go inside a session with the Supreme Court to see how the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful justices avoid the dangers of group dynamics.\n\nEvery once in a while, a book comes along that not only challenges our views of the world but changes the way we think. In Sway, Ori and Rom Brafman not only uncover rational explanations for a wide variety of irrational behaviors but also point readers toward ways to avoid succumbing to their pull.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb18b6f1be5a80d91f2790fdd0709a9006a1c77e","amp;dn":"Sway+-+Ori+Brafman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb18b6f1be5a80d91f2790fdd0709a9006a1c77e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,24,182,241,190,90,128,217,31,39,144,253,208,112,154,144,6,161,199,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
