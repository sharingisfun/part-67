Whether it's animals behaving oddly or even the planet that perplexes, each episode sees scientists studying baffling phenomena in a bid to understand what Mother Nature's really up to. The reasons behind incidents will vary, but there's one conclusion that we always reach: the world isn't as predictable as we'd like to think.\n\n\n\nEpisode 8 : The Whale that Exploded \n\nThis episode focuses on the circumstances surrounding the gruesome events of January 2004 when a dead sperm whale exploded in the middle of a Taiwan street. On the Southern tip of Taiwan a dead sperm whale weighing 56 tons is being transported on the back of a lorry. But at 6.30am the journey turns into a disaster. As the city wakes, it is greeted by an enormous explosion - intestines, blubber and blood blow out of the whale with the force of a bomb. What could have caused this unprecedented explosion?\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2087 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 50:19.720\nNumber Of Parts: 8\nPart Size: 825 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:004f3dfcc56e88eb9bcd158cd6f0e65ae732a133","amp;dn":"Ch5.Nature.Shock.8of8.The.Whale.That.Exploded.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"004f3dfcc56e88eb9bcd158cd6f0e65ae732a133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,79,61,252,197,110,136,235,155,205,21,140,214,240,230,90,231,50,161,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
