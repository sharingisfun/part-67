But they're the same generals we know in name only: their appearance, personality, and gender are all different. One day, first Oda Nobunaga and then all the others are transported to our world. Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb54c8ec2f6fbbf70e04ad09781f47f1ecd9c0df","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+20+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb54c8ec2f6fbbf70e04ad09781f47f1ecd9c0df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,84,200,236,47,111,187,247,14,4,173,9,120,31,71,241,236,217,192,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
