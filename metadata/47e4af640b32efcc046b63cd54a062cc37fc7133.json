There are many other incidents in the press showing the Syrian rebels doing terrible things to people that are inhumane and cruel, but they are supposedly the freedom fighters. When are we going to putting up with these things? Why are we supporting terrorists and terror under the guise of humanitarianism and freedom fighting?\n\nI just had to make sure this video doesn't disappear. You can find it on alternative sites for now, and now here.\n\nI had uploaded another copy made with CamStudio that wasn't correctly configured so the colors were totally off... Not sure how to delete the torrent off this site. The colors in this one are fine.
