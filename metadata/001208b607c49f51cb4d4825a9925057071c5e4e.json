This dynamic original series dramatizes the final hour leading up to several pivotal historical events.

A number of previous missions had been aborted due to technical problems, but it would proved to be a decision that precluded the biggest disaster in NASA'S history. As the world watched, the unthinkable happened. When the shuttle re-entered the earth's atmosphere, a small undetected hole in the wing, caused by a small piece of foam dislodged during the launch, caused the shuttle to disintegrate into a screaming fireball.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2242 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x464\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.552:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46:41.640\nNumber Of Parts: 10\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:001208b607c49f51cb4d4825a9925057071c5e4e","amp;dn":"DC.Zero.Hour.08of10.Columbia.Space.Shuttle.Disaster.XviD.AC3..av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"001208b607c49f51cb4d4825a9925057071c5e4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,18,8,182,7,196,159,81,203,77,72,37,169,146,80,87,7,28,94,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
