Deciding to settle down, he finds a job as a stockboy in the general store of a small town. Trying to fit in, he volunteers to become scoutmaster of the newly formed Troop 1. Becoming more and more involved with the scout troop, he finds his plans to become a lawyer being put on the back burner, until he realizes that his life has been fulfilled helping the youth of the small town. Written by John Ludi  , courtesy IMDB.com\n\nOne of my favorite movies growing up, and still now.  I show it to my son these daysÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n________________________________________\nUsing KMPlayer and VLC, I noticed the audio was a little out of sync with the video.  Using KMPlayer, I was able to correct this for playback by:\n- Right-click on playback screen, choose Ã¢â‚¬ËœPlaybackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ option\n- The next menu opens automatically; choose Ã¢â‚¬ËœAudio Resync&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n- On the next menu, choose Ã¢â‚¬ËœResyncAudio +0.5sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (once or twice!)\n- I find that 4:3 TV format looks the best. Check Ã¢â‚¬ËœScreen ControlsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in KMPlayer menu (again, right-click on screen for main menu) to verify. \n\nPlease let me know how it works in the field.\n \n\nU P L O A D E R S  F I N A L  N O T E S\n\nPlease seed! P-2-P survives when people step up to the plate and help!\nMore seeders = More upload speed to give you new torrents \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e92e0c761983f6e683c00cb1c5de2b28b25a6c50","amp;dn":"FollowMeBoys_1966_Fred_MacMurray_Kurt_Russell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e92e0c761983f6e683c00cb1c5de2b28b25a6c50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,46,12,118,25,131,246,230,131,192,12,177,197,222,43,40,178,90,108,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
