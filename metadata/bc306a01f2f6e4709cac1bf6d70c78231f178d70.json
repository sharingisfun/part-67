Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc306a01f2f6e4709cac1bf6d70c78231f178d70","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+15+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc306a01f2f6e4709cac1bf6d70c78231f178d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,48,106,1,242,246,228,112,156,172,27,246,215,12,120,35,31,23,141,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
