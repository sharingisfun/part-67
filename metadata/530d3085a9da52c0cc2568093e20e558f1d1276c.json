Eyewitness reports vary, but one thing is agreed upon: he wears a Devil mask. This is the story of Val Castillo, a promising gymnast with a strange hobby. She is secretly the neighborhood peeping tom. At first she is alone in this, but when a male friend discovers her doings he joins her in a dark journey of spying and making discoveries about their neighbors that may have been better left alone. Especially secrets that threaten all involved, like Val spying on her own father and stepmother in their bedroom. This snowballs into a journey darker than even the most cynical would care to endure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:530d3085a9da52c0cc2568093e20e558f1d1276c","amp;dn":"Gilbert+Hernandex+-+Speak+of+the+Devil+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"530d3085a9da52c0cc2568093e20e558f1d1276c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,13,48,133,169,218,82,192,204,37,104,9,62,32,229,88,241,209,39,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
