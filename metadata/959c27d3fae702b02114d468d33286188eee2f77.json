There are events where you need to maintain a lead for a specific amount of time or get a certain distance ahead of your opponent. Sometimes you'll have to shake the cops while trying to keep a stolen ride in pristine condition, and there are checkpoint races and circuit races as well. There's not a whole lot that's original here and the races are generally extremely easy--you might not see another car for an entire race once you've cleared the starting line. They're difficult on occasion, but this is usually because of the occasionally choppy frame rate, which makes the otherwise great-handling vehicles a chore to drive when it rears its head. What's odd is that there's really no obvious reason for the game's sometimes poor frame rate; the city doesn't look much different than those in Carbon and Most Wanted.\n\nIn Undercover you play the role of...wait for it...an undercover officer. Along with agent Chase Linh, played by the attractive Maggie Q, your job is to take down a group of street racers that have somehow become involved in an international smuggling ring. The story is told via campy cutscenes that fail to capture the charm of Most Wanted thanks to uninteresting characters and a predictable plot. Having a story provides incentive to make it through race after race, but the whole &quot;this is cheesy so it's cool&quot; thing feels kind of forced this\n\nSCREEN SHOTS &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cheatcc.com/imagesds/needforspeedundercover_00.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cheatcc.com/imagesds/needforspeedundercover_00.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/nfs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/nfs.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:959c27d3fae702b02114d468d33286188eee2f77","amp;dn":"Need+For+Speed+Undercover+Mini+Version%5BPC%5DSnyper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"959c27d3fae702b02114d468d33286188eee2f77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,156,39,211,250,231,2,176,33,20,212,104,211,50,134,24,142,238,47,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
