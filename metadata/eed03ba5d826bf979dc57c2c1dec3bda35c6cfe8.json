High DinerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s retro pop music refuses to be confined by any categorization with the band experimenting with different sounds and instruments and going a completely new direction with each song.\n\nThe band first started getting attention when they shared the energetic and upbeat tune Ã¢â‚¬Å“C.K.F. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really start turning heads until the the release of their self-produced and self-released debut LP Ã¢â‚¬Å“Purple CreekÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in July 2012. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://highdiner.bandcamp.com/album/purple-creek&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://highdiner.bandcamp.com/album/purple-creek&lt;/a&gt;\n\n1.
