Post - \n\n\nThe Mind of the Terrorist: The Psychology of Terrorism from the IRA to al-Qaeda\n\n\nPublished: 2007-12-10 | ISBN: 1403966117 | PDF | 320 pages | 1.10 MB\n\n\nIn contrast to the widely held assumption that terrorists as crazed fanatics, Jerrold Post demonstrates they are psychologically &quot;normal&quot; and that &quot;hatred has been bred in the bone&quot;. He reveals the powerful motivations that drive these ordinary people to such extraordinary evil by exploring the different types of terrorists, from national-separatists like the Irish Republican Army to social revolutionary terrorists like the Shining Path, as well as religious extremists like al-Qaeda and Aum Shinrikyo. In The Mind of the Terrorist, Post uses his expertise to explain how the terrorist mind works and how this information can help us to combat terrorism more effectively","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c891642434c3cf053ee553c2ed88387dba8810df","amp;dn":"The+Mind+of+the+Terrorist.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c891642434c3cf053ee553c2ed88387dba8810df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,145,100,36,52,195,207,5,62,229,83,194,237,136,56,125,186,136,16,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
