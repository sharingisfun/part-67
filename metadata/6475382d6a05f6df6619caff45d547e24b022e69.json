Today, an emerging generation of bands continue to draw on this legacy to confront the political challenges of contemporary Zimbabwe and the uncertain identity issues of the Afrikaans minority in South Africa.\n\nFeaturing music, interviews and rare and unseen archive footage of Suck, Wild Youth, Safari Suits, Power Age, National Wake, KOOS, Kalahari Surfers, The Genuines, Hog Hoggidy Hog, Fuzigish, Sibling Rivalry, 340ml, Panzer, The Rudimentals, Evicted, Sticky Antlers, Freak, LYT, Jagwa Music, Fruits and Veggies, Swivel Foot and more...\n\nPlease seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6475382d6a05f6df6619caff45d547e24b022e69","amp;dn":"PunkInAfrica%28DVDrip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6475382d6a05f6df6619caff45d547e24b022e69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,117,56,45,106,5,246,223,102,25,202,255,69,213,71,226,75,2,46,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
