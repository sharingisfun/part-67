From folky classics like &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin'&quot; to poetic bluesy rock songs like &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues.&quot; \n\nBob Dylan's early days were as tumultuous and groundbreaking as anything else in the history of popular music, he was the undeniable voice of the 60's and so many artists have covered songs included on this recording.  In 1963 Peter, Paul and Mary enjoyed a #2 hit single with &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot; and in 1965 &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; was a number # 1 hit for The Byrds and the Turtles folk-rock version of &quot;It Ain't Me Babe&quot; reached #8.  The epic &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; was the biggest chart hit for Dylan himeslf and the tune Rolling Stone magazine chose as the #1 Pop Song of All Time. \n\nDylan is by now a living legend and recently received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honour. At the award ceremony President Obama said, &quot;Bob's voice, with its weight, its unique gravel power, was re-defining not just what music sounded like, but the message it carried and how it made people feel. There is not a bigger giant in the history of American music.&quot;\n\nThe iconic album cover won the 1967 Grammy award for Best Album Cover, Photography. This release includes a booklet-size copy of the now-familiar psychedelic poster of Dylan done by Milton Glaser that was included in the original LP.\n\nProducers: John H. Hammond, Tom Wilson, Bob Johnston\n\nTracklist:\nRainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35\nBlowin' in the Wind\nThe Times They Are a-Changin'\nIt Ain't Me Babe\nLike a Rolling Stone\nMr. Tambourine Man\nSubterranean Homesick Blues\nI Want You\nPositively 4th Street\nJust Like a Woman\n\nMastered by STEVE HOFFMAN at Stephen Marsh Mastering\n\nComplete artwork included.\n\nEnjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aa3c1e5078582c8ef3d4c6e5819a7a9bc177bee","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan%27s+Greatest+Hits+%5BAudio+Fidelity+Gold+Disc+2012%5D+%28EAC%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aa3c1e5078582c8ef3d4c6e5819a7a9bc177bee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,163,193,229,7,133,130,200,239,61,76,110,88,25,167,169,188,23,123,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
