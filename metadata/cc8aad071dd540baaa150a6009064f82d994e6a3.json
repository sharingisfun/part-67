The application is suited with support for automatic filling of the data as well as capturing user name and password from login pages.\n\nBesides safely keeping passwords and user names, Sticky Password also lets you store bookmarks as well as identities and secure memos. This comes in extremely handy especially when you create a portable version of the application and carry it on a removable device in order to use on different computers.\n\nAccess to the data can be protected through a master password, but additional options are available, such as detection of a Bluetooth or USB device.\n\nOne of the advantages available in Sticky Password is that it can work with a great number of web browsers, from the popular IE, Chrome, Opera or Firefox to less known ones such as Maxthon, Flock, or SeaMonkey. It integrates via its own add-on - you are prompted to install it in the browsers available on the system.\n\nSince the application can detect the credential fields on a web page filling them with the required information is done automatically. Adding a new entry to the database is also automatic.\n\nSticky Password features an import function which helps you easily transfer credentials stored in PWS, XML or INI format from a different password manager or from a web browser into the application. Export is also available as XML, HTML or plain text.\n\nThe built-in password generator lets you create countersigns as lengthy as 99 characters. It also features a tool that assesses the strength of the generated string and a history section.\n\nHandling Sticky Password does not pose any difficulty and it is a useful tool especially for those with large collections of login credentials.\n\n\nWHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 6.0.4.396:\n\nLanguages available: English, Russian, Spanish, Czech, German, French, Polish and Brazilian Portuguese\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ added Polish and Brazilian Portuguese language\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ added support for Firefox/Thunderbird 16 and Seamonkey 2.13\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ improved Opera 12 plugin performance\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Anti-Spy feature is now moved to the main interface of Virtual Keyboard and the keyboard shortcut (long CTRL press) has been disabled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ fixed issue with automatically pressing connect button on the standard Windows VPN window\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ fixed issue with not filling web-sites with .htaccess authorization opened from a shortcut\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ fixed filling of Pinned Sites to the Internet Explorer taskbar\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ fixed shifted buttons on the Manual form edit dialog\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ fixed group-related issues with accounts imported from Lastpass CSV (existing groups not imported\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ accounts not visible on Groups tab)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ fixed error when opening an application account with two logins from Favorites\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ fixed support for autofill on www.tumblr.com and many other sites\n\n                             By bobiras2009\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc8aad071dd540baaa150a6009064f82d994e6a3","amp;dn":"Sticky+Password+PRO+6.0.4.396+Full+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc8aad071dd540baaa150a6009064f82d994e6a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,138,173,7,29,213,64,186,170,21,10,96,9,6,79,130,217,148,230,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
