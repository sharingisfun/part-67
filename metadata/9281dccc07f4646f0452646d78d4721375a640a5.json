This post delayed slightly by a TPB outage.\n\n----------\n\nSTOSSEL - [First Jobs] - Fox Business Network\n2012, July 12, Thursday\n\nXvid/MP3 AVI - encoded from medium quality ReplayTV stream\n\n----------\n\n[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]\n\nWhat was your first job? What did it teach you? Tonight, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Greta Van Susteren, and other Fox personalities tell about their first jobs.\n\nSome first jobs come from unpaid internships. But President Obama's Labor Department says most unpaid internships are illegal. Steven Greenhouse, author of The Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker agrees. He says that government should punish companies that &quot;exploit&quot; free labor. Had that been the practice when I started work, I'd be in trouble. Unpaid interns have made my career possible. The interns were happy too. Many said they learned much more than they learned in college. And they didn't have to pay me tuition.\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban and The National Journalism Center's Hannah Jackman discuss why cracking down on unpaid internships is a dumb idea.\n\nMost Americans support raising the minimum wage. But some workers get their start by working for less than minimum wage. Merv Crist, owner of Ca. restaurant Prime Cut, started working at just $2.25 an hour. He says minimum wage laws hurt young people who just want to get a start.\n\nPeople complain that there are &quot;no jobs,&quot; but FBN's Sandra Smith says there are lots of jobs for vocational school students - jobs that start at $20/hour and require only a high school degree.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9281dccc07f4646f0452646d78d4721375a640a5","amp;dn":"20120712-Stossel-%5BFirst+Jobs%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9281dccc07f4646f0452646d78d4721375a640a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,129,220,204,7,244,100,111,4,82,100,109,120,212,114,19,117,166,64,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
