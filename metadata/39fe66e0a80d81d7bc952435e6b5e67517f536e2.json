Truly haunting and powerfully crafted, Summer of Firefly Memories by newcomer Joan Gable rekindles the soul and ignites the passion of hope and longing. Fiercely independent, eco-journalist Samantha McGreggor has exposed some of the twenty-first centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most alarming environmental enemies and calamities, but lately she has felt uninspired, disillusioned, and nearly apathetic. In hopes of getting her life back on track and awakening her old enthusiasm, she sets off for a summer retreat at the rustic lake resort she hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t visited since her parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ deaths over twenty years ago. In a formidable, thoughtful, lively prose, the author examines the strength of a familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love and the power of their memory.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nWith a PhD in environmental engineering, Joan Gable has spent the past decade in the challenging field of reusing and recycling water in the arid Southwest. She and her husband live in Arizona. This is her first novel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39fe66e0a80d81d7bc952435e6b5e67517f536e2","amp;dn":"Summer+of+Firefly+Memories%3B+Joan+Gable+%28Mobe%2C+Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39fe66e0a80d81d7bc952435e6b5e67517f536e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,254,102,224,168,13,129,215,188,149,36,53,230,181,230,117,23,245,54,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
