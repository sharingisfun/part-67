Has overtones of Carnival of Souls and Between Two Worlds, but Trieste is a lot nicer to look at. And how often do you get to see Trieste anyway?\n\nA lot of viewers drool over Sting,but this is really Kathleen Turner's show - she does great. One of the first movies shot in hi-def video, which yiels an appropriate fuzzy look.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d904c60995a250ddf5a49292ce141f066d7e9389","amp;dn":"Julia+and+Julia+%281987%29+Giulia+e+Giulia+-+Sting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d904c60995a250ddf5a49292ce141f066d7e9389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,4,198,9,149,162,80,221,245,164,146,146,206,20,31,6,109,126,147,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
