He retired to Munich to dictate a sequel to Mein Kampf which focused on foreign policy, expanded on the ideas of Mein Kampf and suggested that around 1980, a final struggle would take place for world domination between the United States and the combined forces of Greater Germany and the British Empire.\n\nOnly two copies of the 200 page manuscript were originally made, and only one of these has ever been made public. Kept strictly secret under HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s orders, the document was placed in a safe in an air raid shelter in 1935 where it remained until its discovery by an American officer in 1945. The authenticity of the book has been verified by Josef Berg (former employee of the Nazi publishing house Eher Verlag) and Telford Taylor (former Brigadier General U.S.A.R. and Chief Counsel at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials). The book was neither edited nor published during the Nazi Germany era and remains known as Zweites Buch (Second Book). The Zweites Buch was first discovered in the Nazi archives being held in the United States by the Jewish American historian Gerhard Weinberg in 1958. Unable to find an American publisher, Weinberg turned to his mentor, Hans Rothfels, and his associate, Martin Broszat, at the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich, who published Zweites Buch in 1961. A pirated edition was published in English in New York, 1962. The first authoritative English edition was not published until 2003 (HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Second Book: The Unpublished Sequel to Mein Kampf, ISBN 1-929631-16-2).\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89076c06e28acf78708e7a03668484ce86dbfacc","amp;dn":"Adolf+Hitler+-+Zweites+Buch+%28The+Unpublished+Sequel+to+Mein+Kamp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89076c06e28acf78708e7a03668484ce86dbfacc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,7,108,6,226,138,207,120,112,142,122,3,102,132,132,206,134,219,250,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
