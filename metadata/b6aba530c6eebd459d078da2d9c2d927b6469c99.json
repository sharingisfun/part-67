Very sloppy typing will magically make sense, even if you miss spaces, and SwiftKey 3 Tablet also predicts your next words.\n\nUpgrading from SwiftKey X, you may experience trouble with apostrophes or accented characters in predictions. This is because you need to update your language models. To do this, go to Settings, Languages &amp; layouts, press menu and tap &quot;update languages&quot;. When &quot;update&quot; appears next to your language(s), press it. When you return to your keyboard things should be working properly. *\n\nSwiftKey 3 Tablet learns the words and phrases you use, and how you interact with your keyboard as you use it, to make typing easier and even more accurate over time. You can also personalize it using your Gmail, Facebook, Twitter or blog posts.\n\nSwiftKey is among Android's best selling apps for a reason -- it transforms your keyboard, making typing a breeze and saving you hassle every day.\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Aug 15, 2012)\n\n    new themes, new languages (Malay &amp; Urdu), ICS &amp; Jelly Bean voice input, bug fixes.\n    New in SwiftKey 3 Tablet:\n    Smart Space - fixes typos even if you miss spaces as you type\n    New look - two beautiful new themes for your keyboard\n    Easier layout - larger space bar, quick punctuation key and other tweaks\n    New languages - seven new languages for our international friends\n    Improved prediction - the words you want, more of the time\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.1+\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6aba530c6eebd459d078da2d9c2d927b6469c99","amp;dn":"SwiftKey+3+Tablet+Keyboard+v3.0.1.330+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6aba530c6eebd459d078da2d9c2d927b6469c99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,171,165,48,198,238,189,69,157,7,141,162,217,194,217,39,182,70,156,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
