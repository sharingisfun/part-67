As if that's not creepy enough, the game also uses as a framing device an original story that is a very intriguing pastiche of Poe mythos.\n\nGameplay involves clicking on various objects and people to trigger events to advance the story. Despite this limited click-and-watch, the game's haunting atmosphere and style (with unique claymation actors) make it a must-have for horror fans. If you are a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, you'll tremendously enjoy this CD-ROM; if you're not, this is one CD that will spark your interest in his works. A must-have, and a proud entrant into our Hall of Belated Fame.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hotud.org/component/content/article/38-adventure/19962&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hotud.org/component/content/article/38-adventure/19962&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd0696de04938405588534dbcfeb67b1a9ac9a80","amp;dn":"Dark+Eye","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd0696de04938405588534dbcfeb67b1a9ac9a80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,6,150,222,4,147,132,5,88,133,52,219,207,235,103,177,169,172,154,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
