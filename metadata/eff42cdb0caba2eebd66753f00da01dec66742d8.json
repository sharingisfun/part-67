The live album consists of twelve tracks of live material, which includes four of her major hits between 1957 and 1962: &quot;Walkin' After Midnight,&quot; &quot;I Fall to Pieces,&quot; &quot;Crazy,&quot; and &quot;She's Got You.&quot; According to Allmusic reviewer, Mike Henderson Cline sings a &quot;wide variety&quot; of songs on the album, such as Rock and Roll, Jazz, Traditional Pop, and Tin Pan Alley. Cline includes a cover version of Carl Smith's &quot;Loose Talk&quot; (which she had never recorded) and Hank Williams's &quot;Lovesick Blues. The album also includes five additional songs from her years at Four Star Records, such as her debut single, &quot;A Church, a Courtroom, and Goodbye,&quot; &quot;There He Goes,&quot; and &quot;How Can I Face Tomorrow.&quot;\n\nAlthough originally released on a vinyl record in 1988, the album was soon available on compact disc and cassette. The cover art had originally been taken by Les Leverett and was digitally remastered by Glenn Meadows, Milan Bogdan, Jim Loyd and Benny Quinn at Masterfonics. Upon its release, the album peaked at #60 on the Billboard Magazine Top Country Albums chart.\nAlbum Title: Live at the Opry\nArtist | Group: Patsy Cline\nLabel: Universal Special Products\nRelease date: 1988\nGenre: Country\nNumber of track(s): 12\nFile format: mp3\nTotal duration: 00h:28m:30s:022ms\nTotal size: 65.22759 MB\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nA Church, a Courtroom, and Then Goodbye\nI've Loved and Lost Again\nWalkin' After Midnight\nLovesick Blues\nHow Can I Face Tomorrow\nLoose Talk\nCrazy Dreams\nThere He Goes\nLovin' in Vain\nI Fall to Pieces\nShe's Got You\nCrazy\n\n\nFile name: 01 A Church, a Courtroom, and Then Goodbye.mp3\nDuration: 3mn 18s\nBit rate: 320 Kbps\nBit rate mode: CBR\nFile size: 7.59 MiB\nTrack number: 1\n\nFile name: 02 I've Loved and Lost Again.mp3\nDuration: 2mn 31s\nBit rate: 320 Kbps\nBit rate mode: CBR\nFile size: 5.77 MiB\nTrack number: 2\n\nFile name: 03 Walkin' After Midnight.mp3\nDuration: 2mn 24s\nBit rate: 320 Kbps\nBit rate mode: CBR\nFile size: 5.53 MiB\nTrack number: 3\n\nFile name: 04 Lovesick Blues.mp3\nDuration: 2mn 8s\nBit rate: 320 Kbps\nBit rate mode: CBR\nFile size: 4.89 MiB\nTrack number: 4\n\nFile name: 05 How Can I Face Tomorrow.mp3\nDuration: 2mn 1s\nBit rate: 320 Kbps\nBit rate mode: CBR\nFile size: 4.62 MiB\nTrack number: 5\n\nFile name: 06 Loose Talk.mp3\nDuration: 1mn 42s\nBit rate: 320 Kbps\nBit rate mode: CBR\nFile size: 3.90 MiB\nTrack number: 6\n\nFile name: 07 Crazy Dreams.mp3\nDuration: 2mn 3s\nBit rate: 320 Kbps\nBit rate mode: CBR\nFile size: 4.70 MiB\nTrack number: 7\n\nFile name: 08 There He Goes.mp3\nDuration: 2mn 18s\nBit rate: 320 Kbps\nBit rate mode: CBR\nFile size: 5.30 MiB\nTrack number: 8\n\nFile name: 09 Lovin' in Vain.mp3\nDuration: 1mn 41s\nBit rate: 320 Kbps\nBit rate mode: CBR\nFile size: 3.87 MiB\nTrack number: 9\n\nFile name: 10 I Fall to Pieces.mp3\nDuration: 3mn 4s\nBit rate: 320 Kbps\nBit rate mode: CBR\nFile size: 7.03 MiB\nTrack number: 10\n\nFile name: 11 She's Got You.mp3\nDuration: 2mn 55s\nBit rate: 320 Kbps\nBit rate mode: CBR\nFile size: 6.70 MiB\nTrack number: 11\n\nFile name: 12 Crazy.mp3\nDuration: 2mn 20s\nBit rate: 320 Kbps\nBit rate mode: CBR\nFile size: 5.34 MiB\nTrack number: 12 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eff42cdb0caba2eebd66753f00da01dec66742d8","amp;dn":"Patsy+Cline+Live+at+The+Opry+1956+to+1962+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eff42cdb0caba2eebd66753f00da01dec66742d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,244,44,219,12,171,162,238,189,102,117,63,0,218,1,222,198,103,66,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
