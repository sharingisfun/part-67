The Lost Coast level was originally created for Half-Life 2, but was ultimately removed from the game. As a result, it has several minor story details that were not included in Half-Life 2. The level received a generally positive reception, and there was consensus among reviewers that the new features included in Lost Coast should be integrated into future games released by Valve\n\nThis is more of a mini game than a anything else; you should finish it fairly quickly, but it IS fun to play.\n\nXpadder with profiles for Xbox360 &amp; PS3 included.\n\nExtract &amp; Play.
