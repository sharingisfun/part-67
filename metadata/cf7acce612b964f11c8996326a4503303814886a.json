The lover is not ready to accept the responsibility. The widow is forced to abort.\n\nIn the ensuing commotion the father is called back. He is forced to give his decision. He pronounces her dead and performs her 'Ghata-Shraddha' (a ritual where an immoral person is ex-communicated, pronounced dead and her last rites performed when the accused is still alive, thus depriving her of all worldly relations).\n\nWhile the Brahmin society praises the guru, individuals revolt. The head disciple leaves the town; the child-novice goes back to his parents; and the Koga refuses the 'heaven' and 'salvation'.\n\nIt was awarded the 1992 National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi and 1992 Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie\n\nCast:\nNana Patekar\nManohar Singh\nVijay Kashyap\nAshish Mishra\nRajashri Sawant\nK.
