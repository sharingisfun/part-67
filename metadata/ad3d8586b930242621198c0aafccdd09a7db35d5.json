The player assumes the role of F.E.A.R.'s Point Man, who possesses superhuman reflexes, and must uncover the secrets of a paranormal menace in the form of a little girl.\nThe player character uses reflex time while firing on a group of soldiers.\nThe game contains weapons based on non-fictional firearms, such as pistols, assault rifles, and submachine guns, as well as entirely fictional armaments like particle beam weapons. Each firearm differs in terms of ammunition type, accuracy, range, fire rate, damage, and bulkiness. The latter characteristic is crucial, as more powerful/specialized weapons tend to be more cumbersome and slow the player's maneuvers. F.E.A.R. does not scale guns on a curve, so any firearm is potentially deadly in most situations. Monolith Productions stated that it aimed for &quot;... a balanced arsenal where each weapon serves a specific function&quot;, rather than &quot;... just going with a bunch of real-world submachine guns and assault rifles.&quot;[8] F.E.A.R.'s heads-up display crosshair's size dynamically shows where shots will fall based on movement, aim, and the weapon in use. The player may carry only three firearms at a time; thus, strategy is required when using and selecting weapons.\nCompared to other shooters where melee is usually a last resort, F.E.A.R.'s melee is a viable instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies. The stocks of all firearms can be used in close combat. Lighter weapons, while being less powerful, allow the player to move around more quickly, increasing their chances of melee. Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which also allows them to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad3d8586b930242621198c0aafccdd09a7db35d5","amp;dn":"PC%26gt%3B%26gt%3B%5BF.E.A.R%5D%5BSnyper%5DNO+RIP+%2F100%25+WORKING%26lt%3BFIRST.ENCOUNT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad3d8586b930242621198c0aafccdd09a7db35d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,61,133,134,185,48,36,38,33,25,140,10,175,204,221,9,167,219,53,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
