Lossless quality. Covers included. Different masterings for different tastes. If you don't like them, you can always buy the remaster, anyway...\n\nQuite possibly the very best album of a criminally underrated band. The title track, along with other songs such as &quot;Fall in Love with Me&quot; &quot;Despair&quot; or &quot;In Vogue&quot; are all classic stuff.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32bd1a4c866ae9bb70b3a594c1221bb751aded7b","amp;dn":"JAPAN+-+Quiet+Life+%281979%29+3+versions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32bd1a4c866ae9bb70b3a594c1221bb751aded7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,189,26,76,134,106,233,187,112,179,165,148,193,34,27,183,81,173,237,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
