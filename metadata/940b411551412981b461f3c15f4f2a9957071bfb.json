If you're curious, read here:\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_from_the_Black_Hole\n\nThis is a &quot;Songs From The Black Hole&quot; recreation, recorded from scratch, which incorporates material from all the released Rivers Cuomo demos, the full band Weezer demos for the project, the Pinkerton recordings, and information from the many pages of notes, lyrics and sheet music in &quot;The Pinkerton Diaries&quot; which was released last year (as well as a small amount of our own creative input). A bunch of people worked on this over a long period of time.\n\n\nPerhaps I'll put up some more information about this later on.\ncredits\nreleased 06 September 2012\nLead Vocals:\nJonas: Nick Walker\nMaria: Allie Cornish\nLaural: Beverly P. / Krista Mergist\nWuan: Felix Kern\nDondÃƒÂ³: Marcel Messy\nM-1: Doug Liggins\n\nAdditional vocals on tracks 3, 9, 11, 15, 16, 21, 23, 26, 27: Marcel Messy\nAdditional vocals on tracks 9, 23, 26: Felix Kern\nAdditional vocals on track 10: Jack Mergist\nAdditional vocals on track 15: Jack Allen\n\nDrums, Acoustic Guitar, Electric Guitar, Bass, Upright Piano, Synth, Organ, Percussion: Jack Allen\nClarinet: Andrew Bergman\nSamples: Cody Lamie and Jack Allen\n\nProduced by Operation Space Opera\nMixed by Jack Allen\nMastered by Jack Allen\nAlbum Cover / Art Direction by J.R.
