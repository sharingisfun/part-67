Correct speech length. I wasted around 1-2 days figuring out where the sound length is stored (it's RuneFactoryWii.brsar) and writing a script to copy sound length from jap version\n2. Some sounds from US version do not have counterparts in JP version. I left them as is, maybe there will be some english voices in some rare/extra scenes.\n3. Checked Lava Ruins - works ok.\n4. Couldn't check the whole game, I am just starting to play it. In case you find any errors, you're welcome to fix them and reupload the fixed version. All I ask is credit for sound length fix (can't believe no one tried to fix that so far :()\n5. I included 'source' JP files for people who have a original US iso and can do the replace themselves (replace the files using wit or whatever program you're used to).\n6. Savefiles seems to be compatible with US version. I continued my own game and didn't encounter any errors so far.\n\nPlease do not post any messages to me here, I probably won't read them.

Please attach savefiles if you're using Dolphin emulator and a small directions how to reproduce the error (who to talk to etc...)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb95751ee77b821a1f1de93c222f14741af56d42","amp;dn":"RFF_UNDUB_Andys_1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb95751ee77b821a1f1de93c222f14741af56d42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,149,117,30,231,123,130,26,31,29,233,60,34,47,20,116,26,245,109,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
