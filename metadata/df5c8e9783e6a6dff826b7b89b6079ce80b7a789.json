Utilising nifty shifts in tempo and approach, compositions can change from Black Sabbath-type riffs to brass-infused funk in a moment, as revealed from the get go on Hitchy. On Park Street, the mix is even more imaginative as blends of 70s wah-wah guitar with soaring lead breaks highlighting the percussive and solid rhythmic structure. Following the upbeat and reggae-styled Sugar, Left or Right focus on its tight harmonies on Right for Me. At times one could feel they have stepped into the field of a 70s music festival and be inspired to stay a while in the sounds of Left or Right. Members Callum Hampton, Metua Marama and Stephen Marshall have got their sound heading in a number of directions. Culminating in the final track Sleep, Left or Right would be a killer band to see live","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df5c8e9783e6a6dff826b7b89b6079ce80b7a789","amp;dn":"Left.Or.Right.Buzzy.Nuggety","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df5c8e9783e6a6dff826b7b89b6079ce80b7a789","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,92,142,151,131,230,166,223,248,38,183,184,155,96,121,206,128,183,167,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
