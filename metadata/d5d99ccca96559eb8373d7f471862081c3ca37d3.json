Was it is Kenya, Indonesia or Hawaii? This was truly surprising on part of American populist media who refuse to verify the authenticity of so called birth certificate of American president. In this deeply researched, fascinating exploration of the ideas and rhetoric that have animated extreme, mostly right-wing movements throughout American history, Arthur Goldwag reveals the disturbing pattern of fear-mongering and demagoguery that runs through the American grain.\n\n\n\nThe New Hate takes readers on a surprising, often shocking, sometimes bizarrely amusing tour through the swamps of nativism, racism, and paranoid speculations about money that have long thrived on the American fringe. Goldwag shows us the parallels between the hysteria about the Illuminati that wracked the new American Republic in the 1790s and the McCarthyism that roiled the 1950s, and he discusses the similarities between the antiÃ¢â‚¬â€œNew Deal forces of the 1930s and the Tea Party movement today. He traces Henry FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s anti-Semitism and the John Birch SocietyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“InsidersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ back to the notorious Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and he relates white supremacist nightmares about racial pollution to nineteenth-century fears of papal plots.\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“The most salient feature of what I have come to call the New Hate,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Goldwag writes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“is its sameness across time and space. The most depressing thing about the demagogues who tirelessly exploit itÃ¢â‚¬â€in pamphlets and books and partisan newspapers two centuries ago, on Web sites, electronic social networks, and twenty-four-hour cable news todayÃ¢â‚¬â€is how much alike they all turn out to be.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5d99ccca96559eb8373d7f471862081c3ca37d3","amp;dn":"The+New+Hate+A+History+of+Fear+and+Loathing+on+the+Populist+Righ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5d99ccca96559eb8373d7f471862081c3ca37d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,217,156,204,169,101,89,235,131,115,215,244,113,134,32,129,195,202,55,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
