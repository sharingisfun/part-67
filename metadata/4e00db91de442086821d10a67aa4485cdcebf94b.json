Hudson focuses on the one thread of continuity which he sees as both the seed and the fruit of this exciting era: the awakening of secular humanism and the emergence of the Individual. This history gives the listener a lucid, perceptive analysis of the splendid Renaissance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e00db91de442086821d10a67aa4485cdcebf94b","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+the+Renaissance+-+William+Henry+Hudson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e00db91de442086821d10a67aa4485cdcebf94b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,0,219,145,222,68,32,134,130,29,16,166,122,164,72,92,220,235,249,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
