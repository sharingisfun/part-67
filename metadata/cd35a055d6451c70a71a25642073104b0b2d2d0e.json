Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd35a055d6451c70a71a25642073104b0b2d2d0e","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+15+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd35a055d6451c70a71a25642073104b0b2d2d0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,53,160,85,214,69,28,112,167,26,37,100,32,115,16,75,11,45,45,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
