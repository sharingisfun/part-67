What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 11 - Monday - The bottom 3 dishes from yesterday's Invention Test face a Pressure Test where someone will go home! The contestants attempt to make guest chef Grant King's highly technical dish. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0387e4a1fb969b5e16767330502b8da2e3d468b2","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E62.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0387e4a1fb969b5e16767330502b8da2e3d468b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,135,228,161,251,150,155,94,22,118,115,48,80,43,141,162,227,212,104,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
