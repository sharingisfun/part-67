Start here: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ubuntu: An Absolute BeginnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s GuideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, by author Courtney Loo, is the latest free guide from MakeUseOf and will teach you everything you need to know about Ubuntu in easy-to-understand language.\n\nUbuntu is a free/libre, open-source computer operating system with 20 million users worldwide. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also so much more than that: it is an ethos, a collaborative project and, first and foremost, Ubuntu is a community of people.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re reading this guide, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re probably interested in moving away from proprietary operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS X; perhaps youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already installed Ubuntu on your computer but are not sure where to start.\n\nMigrating to a new operating system can be daunting, especially when faced with unfamiliar words like Ã¢â‚¬ËœFLOSSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcommand line interfaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœkernelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Many people are intimidated by the technical jargon of a non-commercial operating system and believe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too advanced for them.\n\nWell, that is simply not true.\n\nUbuntu is easy to install and simple to use. Best of all: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s completely FREE!
