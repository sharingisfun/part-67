The languages for which there are \nmore than 1 translation are : English (9) , German (2) , Spanish (2) , Urdu (2).\n\n_ 1. Install Quran Viewer v 2.9 by clicking : QViewer 2.9.exe.\n_ 2. Install the Quran translation you are interested in by clicking the corresponding *.dbt\nfile OR by going to Languages&gt;Translations Manager. Restart Quran Viewer after \ninstalling a translation module or a desired font (*.ttf).\n\n_ A useful feature is the view feature where you can arrange for the software to display \nmultiple translations at the same time (Languages&gt;Views Manager) (don't forget to restart \nQur'an Viewer).\n\n_ After experimenting with the software for a while, I am sure you will manage to \nunderstand all the useful features.\n\n_ The folders whose name are starting by &quot;_&quot; are just extra stuff for those who might be \ninterested.\n\n\n==&gt; Acknowledgement : \n_ May Allah (swt) reward generously JAMAL AL-NASIR who undoubtedly spent many hours of code writing/debugging to provide Muslims - as well as Non-Muslims - with this very nice-looking and stable Multilingual Quran-Viewer freeware. \n_ As I understand, Multilingual Qur'an Viewer is no longer being supported or developed since JAMAL AL-NASIR had to step down for personal reasons....So, cyber-dwellers : get it while you can !. \n\n==&gt; Final Words : \n_ If you are approaching the Qur'an for the first time, I would advise you to start reading it starting from the end (like I did), a few pages at a time. \n_ &quot;Good Luck&quot;. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09da0a80980baed0669d4da1a2fe48a145ba1e8e","amp;dn":"Quran+Viewer+2.9+DIST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09da0a80980baed0669d4da1a2fe48a145ba1e8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,218,10,128,152,11,174,208,102,157,77,161,162,254,72,161,69,186,30,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
