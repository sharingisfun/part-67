They will be brought together by a terrible accident that will change their lives. By the final frame, none of them will be the same as they will learn harsh truths about love, faith, courage, desire and guilt, and how chance can change our worlds irretrievably, forever. \n\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315733/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f16bb976b6419c75122a0dd8bd289655bc328b91","amp;dn":"21+Grams+%282003%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f16bb976b6419c75122a0dd8bd289655bc328b91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,107,185,118,182,65,156,117,18,42,13,216,189,40,150,85,188,50,139,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
