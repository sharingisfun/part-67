Building on recent scholarship that examines and reconstructs the design process of classical architecture, John R. Senseney focuses on technical drawing in the building trade as a model for the expression of visual order, showing that the techniques of ancient Greek drawing actively determined concepts about the world. He argues that the uniquely Greek innovations of graphic construction determined principles that shaped the massing, special qualities, and refinements of buildings and the manner in which order itself was envisioned.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 262 pages\n# Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (March 14, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1107002354\n# ISBN-13: 978-1107002357","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b95e9d0994049329560f3dd6c0fce2bb78e14351","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Building+in+the+Classical+World+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b95e9d0994049329560f3dd6c0fce2bb78e14351","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,94,157,9,148,4,147,41,86,15,61,214,192,252,226,187,120,225,67,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
