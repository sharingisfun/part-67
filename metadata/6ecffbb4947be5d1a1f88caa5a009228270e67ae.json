If you like 'The Oils' this sundown concert is a must. I simply can't believe that nobody else cares enough to keep this torrent live. (I downloaded it in the 'Kazaa' p2p days.) I'll keep this alive part-time for a month and see what happens. Seed or it will die!\n\nAudio is good, video is as good as it got in Oz 1985 (from master analogue tape).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ecffbb4947be5d1a1f88caa5a009228270e67ae","amp;dn":"Midnight+Oil+-+Oils+On+The+Water+%28Sydney+1985%29+pdtv+xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ecffbb4947be5d1a1f88caa5a009228270e67ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,207,251,180,148,123,229,209,161,248,140,170,90,0,146,40,39,14,103,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
