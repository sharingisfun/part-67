Of course, it's not plain sailing and his ship, Providence, soon stumbles across a storm which forces the unlikely band of travellers together. The 13-part series promises &quot;a 21st century take on the classic 8th century iconic hero&quot; for Sky1. Newcomer Elliot Knight plays Sinbad while his nemesis Lord Akbari is played by Lost's Naveen Andrews. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tv.com/shows/sinbad-uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tv.com/shows/sinbad-uk/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVideo: 1280*720  (WEB-DL)\nContainer: x264 MKV\nAudio: DD5.1\nSubs: Custom NL (Instelbaar)r3p0\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1979918/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1979918/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60d4ffc89752e730c6b0b9e02841dff5d15918b1","amp;dn":"SINBAD+%282012%29+S01e03+720p+NLsubs+TBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60d4ffc89752e730c6b0b9e02841dff5d15918b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,212,255,200,151,82,231,48,198,176,185,224,40,65,223,245,209,89,24,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
