Each chapter is specifically designed to show you the importance of your personal beliefs, thoughts, desires and emotions, and how all combine together as one to make the life you live right nowÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as the life you will live. \n \nShown inside is precise guidance on how when you change, even only one, what you live changes. You will be shown how what you believe, think and feel right now is the only thing relevant. Therefore, the past will no longer have power, only used as a reference point for where you want to be. \n\nWith a humour you can't quite put you finger on, it by no means tells the long dragged out storyÃ¢â‚¬â€to the point, no messing words of wisdom.
