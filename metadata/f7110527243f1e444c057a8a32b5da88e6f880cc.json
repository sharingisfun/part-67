He is also the founding Pastor of Times Square Church in New York City, an interdenominational church, and President of World Challenge, Inc.  Wilkerson's sermons are known for being direct and frank. He emphasizes Christian beliefs, such as: God's holiness and righteousness, God's love towards humans and especially Christian views of Jesus. Wilkerson tries to avoid categorizing Christians into distinct groups according to the parish they belong to, and as such he is considered by many to be a truly ecumenical evangelist.\n\nGod had a plan that you and I would not only survive but that we would be more than over comers. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter how wicked the world becomes and what the devil brings on society Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we have abiding in us a power that is greater than any other power. This power is the Holy Spirit!! You have not fully received the Holy Spirit until you allow Him to do what He was sent to do. We are to cast every burden on Him Ã¢â‚¬â€œHE is the Burden Bearer. As we turn every burden over to Him Ã¢â‚¬â€œ We are receiving Him.  David Wilkerson's powerful preaching against the Great Apostasy taking root in the Church in these last days\n\nThe following video sermons are included:\nPraying In The Closet by David Wilkerson\nOur God Can Fix Anything by David Wilkerson\nPredicazione del Pastore David Wilkerson del 16 Maggio 2002\nLosing The Anointing by David Wilkerson\nCasting Down Unbelief by David Wilkerson\nBeware Of Dogs by David Wilkerson\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7110527243f1e444c057a8a32b5da88e6f880cc","amp;dn":"POtHS+2+-+Bible+Study+-+Part+80+-+Praying+In+The+Closet+by+David","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7110527243f1e444c057a8a32b5da88e6f880cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,17,5,39,36,63,30,68,76,5,122,138,50,181,218,136,230,248,128,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
