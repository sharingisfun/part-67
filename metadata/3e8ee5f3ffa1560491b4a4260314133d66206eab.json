We hope you enjoy using this release. Please note that you can upgrade to final from the Release Candidates when  the time is ready.\nWe now have many updated applications, including LibreOffice 3.5.0 and VLC 2.0 Ã¢â‚¬Å“TwoflowerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. We are committed to delivering the most up to date applications that we can, on the most solid and stable base possible. This release also sees the introduction of the First Run Wizard. Documentation will soon be put on the SolusOS Wiki regarding the new tool, and the operating system. The tool helps you set up your system for the first time, including networking tasks, the firewall, graphics drivers, and how often to update the computer.\nNow is the best possible time to get involved in SolusOS. Whether its in the forums, the IRC support or by contributing code or donations, you can help shape the future of our project. We are changing the current view on many things; the idea that you have to have a rolling or bleeding edge base system to enjoy new software is wrong. SolusOS refines many concepts, and allows you to enjoy modern software and stability, as it always should have been.\nLast but not least, SolusOS is about enjoying your time behind the screen. Computing shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be a mundane task, it should engage you and leave you wanting more from your computer, knowing that you can have more. Stick around, the ride has only just begun :)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://solusos.com/solusos-rc2/#comments&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://solusos.com/solusos-rc2/#comments&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.solusos.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.solusos.com/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://solusos.com/donations/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://solusos.com/donations/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmd5sum : adce80f751f7152fd00d3ae4441b51ba  SolusOS-RC2.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e8ee5f3ffa1560491b4a4260314133d66206eab","amp;dn":"SolusOS-RC2.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e8ee5f3ffa1560491b4a4260314133d66206eab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,142,229,243,255,161,86,4,145,180,164,38,3,20,19,61,102,32,110,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
