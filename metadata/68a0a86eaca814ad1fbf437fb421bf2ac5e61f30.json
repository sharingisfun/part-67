A curfew was imposed by the Indian Army, unsuccessfully  as it turned out, public protests by millions of Kashmiris swelling the  valleyÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs streets calling for an end to Indian rule. In less than a week,  Indian forces killed more than thirty unarmed civilians including a  prominent political leader  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ  Sheikh Abdul Aziz. The public protest  started as the Indian government transferred 40 hectares of land to a Hindu trust that manages a local shrine, Amarnath, amid fears that  India is trying to bring about slow demographic change as the number of Muslim population has dwindled significantly over the last six dec-ades. What started as a public protest against a small land issue soon  turned into massive civil disobedience movement and demands of  freedom from India. However, once again the political dispute was  transformed into a communal confrontation as thousands of Hindu  militant extremists supported by the government joined the violent  anti-Kashmiri protests who were labelled under categories like Islamic terroristsÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ,separatistsÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ and of course communalÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ, once again putting the religion at the heart of a struggle that is mainly political.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68a0a86eaca814ad1fbf437fb421bf2ac5e61f30","amp;dn":"KASHMIR-Islam%2Cidentity_and_insurgency.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68a0a86eaca814ad1fbf437fb421bf2ac5e61f30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,160,168,110,172,168,20,173,31,191,67,127,180,33,191,42,197,230,31,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
