I \nwould describe it as a do-it-yourself kit for those who like to build and \nexperiment, but not the typical home shelving or brick bar-b-q units for the back yard. Now if you like electronics, computers, experiments of all kinds, then you might want to take a look at these. Some examples of show titles are: Aerial kite photography, Computer Music Making, Kinetic Wave Sculpture, Steampunk, \nand more. Enjoy!\n\nCT\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80ef51627c61f95b0f2a9c02c722147317d566bc","amp;dn":"Make_Season_One_Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80ef51627c61f95b0f2a9c02c722147317d566bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,239,81,98,124,97,249,91,15,42,156,2,199,34,20,115,23,213,102,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
