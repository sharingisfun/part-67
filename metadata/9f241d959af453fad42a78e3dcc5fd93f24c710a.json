Extremely simple to use, it functions just like the classic Mac OS Trashcan - files and folders dropped on it are moved to the trash, and disks droppped on it are ejected. In addition, it also features numerous functions for the power user. You can use it to instantly delete or shred file and folders without sending them to the trash. You can use it to empty or shred trash only on selected disks. And of course, you can use it just like the trashcan you've always had on your desktop. Trash X is completely safe and it requires no system hacks or Terminal command line voodoo. Place an alias or copy of it on your desktop, in your documents folder, or anywhere else you wish. COOL TIP: Put Trash X in your Finder windows toolbar to have easy access to it in any folder.\n\nWhat's New\nVersion 1.9.2:\n\nUpdated for OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion Gatekeeper.\nMinor optimizations and improvements.\n\nRequirements\nPPC / Intel, Mac OS X 10.4 or later \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f241d959af453fad42a78e3dcc5fd93f24c710a","amp;dn":"Trash+X+1.9.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f241d959af453fad42a78e3dcc5fd93f24c710a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,36,29,149,154,244,83,250,212,42,120,227,220,197,253,147,242,76,113,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
