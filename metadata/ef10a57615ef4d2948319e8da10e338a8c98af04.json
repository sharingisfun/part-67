Works absolutely great. I think its missing only 2 roms and has a total of 54 games. Runs awesome and the graphics and sound are fantastic. Ill be seeding on and off but you will eventually get it. This is for PC but it would be nice to see it ported to the 360 sometime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef10a57615ef4d2948319e8da10e338a8c98af04","amp;dn":"Sega+Model+2.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef10a57615ef4d2948319e8da10e338a8c98af04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,16,165,118,21,239,77,41,72,49,158,141,161,14,51,138,140,152,175,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
