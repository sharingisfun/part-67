A killer transposition at the end takes all the heat off you.\n\nBackhanded: Three different coins vanish and appear under a card, then backfire to your hand. This routine uses sound in a very clever way.\n\nFamous Three Coin Trick: Three coins vanish and reappear (one visually on the spectator's hand)! Then they vanish again, and appear in the coin purse on the table!\n\nEZ Triple Wildcoin: Two half dollars change into English pennies then Chinese coins in this very easy version of a classic plot.\n\nDown Spout: A beautiful and easy Coin in Bottle.\n\nCaptivating: Lean and strong-three coins are magically dumped from a pen cap!\n\nHook Revisited: A reworking of Larry Jennings' famous Hook routine, wherein three coins are hung invisibly in the air. You end clean, clean, clean!\n\nWishing Cards: Three coins are produced impossibly from between two cards.\n\nPayout: A follow-up to the Wishing Cards routine: Three coins ore vanished one at a time into the two cards used to produce them. As the cards are lifted all three coins instantly appear!\n\nCoins &amp; Cylinder (Performance Only): Doug's version of Ramsay's famous trick. \n\n----------------------------------------------\nYou can download the full DVDs and the rest \nof the series on Usenet at alt.binaries.magic \n(see the included pdf in this download).\n----------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:620a656c411e3a5003ef8848b582361e7a179cae","amp;dn":"Magicians+-+Doug+Brewer+-+Unexpected+Visitor+vol.1+-+DVDRip+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"620a656c411e3a5003ef8848b582361e7a179cae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,10,101,108,65,30,58,80,3,239,136,72,181,130,54,30,122,23,156,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
