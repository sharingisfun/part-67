I have started with season 02 as there seems to be enough files uploaded to cover season 01.  Amazon does state season 01 is suppose to be released may 29th 2012 on dvd.\n\n5 seasons total for this series depends on demand how many i will upload\n\nStoryline\n\nBrett and Bart Maverick (and in later seasons, their English cousin, Beau) are well dressed gamblers who migrate from town to town always looking for a good game. Poker (5 card draw) is their favorite but they've been known to play such odd card games as Three-toed Sloth on occasion. The show would occasionally feature both or all three Mavericks, but usually would rotate the central character from week to week.  \n\nUser Review:\n\nI Would like to see a good quality DVD set of the Maverick series. I know of none. I have been watching on Encore and Would be interested in good a decent quality DVD set of the series. I bought the 22 DVD set from DVDMediastar.com in Canada www.dvdmediastar.com for $USD $79.95 and was very disappointed and returned it. I have seen other sets that are on other web sites and auction sites and have looked at a couple, but they all seem to be the same set or a copy of the set. Quality of these obviously unauthorized DVDs is nothing like the episodes shown on Encore (many show the channel it was taped from in the corner). I doubt that Warner Brothers will release the whole series in an authorized release.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d53c26cb3d00fd1e61b15490333c817d9ce6fb03","amp;dn":"Maverick+Season+04+E01+-+11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d53c26cb3d00fd1e61b15490333c817d9ce6fb03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,60,38,203,61,0,253,30,97,177,84,144,51,60,129,125,156,230,251,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
