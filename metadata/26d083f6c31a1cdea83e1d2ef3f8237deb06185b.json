But they're the same generals we know in name only: their appearance, personality, and gender are all different. One day, first Oda Nobunaga and then all the others are transported to our world. Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26d083f6c31a1cdea83e1d2ef3f8237deb06185b","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+17+%5B480p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26d083f6c31a1cdea83e1d2ef3f8237deb06185b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,208,131,246,195,26,28,222,168,62,29,46,243,248,35,125,235,6,24,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
