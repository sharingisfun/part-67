Passionate, fearless, and committed, Dian devoted eighteen years to study gorillas in the mountainous rainforest of Volcanoes National Park. Less well-known, however, is Bob Campbell wildlife photographer and filmmaker whose footage propelled Dian and the mountain gorillas into the international spotlight. Campbell was hired by National Geographic to film Fosseys work, and from 1968 to 1972 he shot 70,000 feet of film. Unfortunately, most of it has never been seen. Now, National Geographic is unveiling this extraordinary glimpse into the world of the mountain gorillas and Dian's unique rapport with them in MOUNTAIN GORILLAS:THE LOST FILM OF DIAN FOSSEY.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1925 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 624x472\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.322:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 53:37.080\nNumber Of Parts: 14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ef59e2535c98eb5f078bd203b0989d9fdb41e36","amp;dn":"NG.Wildlife.Wonders.01of14.The.Lost.Film.of.Dian.Fossey.XviD.AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ef59e2535c98eb5f078bd203b0989d9fdb41e36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,245,158,37,53,201,142,181,240,120,189,32,59,9,137,217,253,180,30,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
