I searched the great TPB site for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alpha FlightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comics, but could only locate a few copies of Volume 4.\n\nSo, after a bit more research, I found what I was looking for, and more.  I have since compiled my findings into five separate torrents, named thusly:  Alpha Flight Volume 1; Alpha Flight Volume 2; Alpha Flight Volume 3; Alpha Flight Volume 4 and Alpha Flight Miscellaneous.  All of these torrents are presented here, for your downloading/reading pleasures.\n\nAlpha Flight Volume 1 (1983) consists of ALL 130 Alpha Flight issues, plus the two Annuals, 1986 and 1987.  \n\nAlpha Flight Volume 2 (1997) consists of ALL 21 AF issues, plus the 1998 Annual.  \n\nAlpha Flight Volume 3 (2004) consists of ALL 12 AF issues.  \n\nAlpha Flight Volume 4 (2011) consists of ALL nine issues.  \n\nAlpha Flight Miscellaneous contains:  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alpha Flight Classic 1Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a compilation of AF Volume 1, 1-8;) Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alpha Flight Classic 2Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a compilation of AF Volume 1, 9-19 + X-Men 109;) ALL five issues of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Omega FlightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (which was part of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“The InitiativeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ saga; and finally, an issue of, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What IfÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ entitled, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What IfÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Wolverine Led Alpha Flight.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAlpha Flight is a fictional superhero team published by Marvel Comics, noteworthy for being one of the few Canadian superhero teams.  Created by the great John Byrne, the team first appeared in Uncanny X-Men 120, in April of 1979.\n\nAlpha Flight is noted for being &quot;Canada's answer to the Avengers.&quot;  Most team members have distinctly Canadian attributes, such as Inuit, or First Nations heritage.  Throughout most of its history, the team has worked for Department H, a fictional branch of CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Department of National Defence that deals with super-powered villains.\n\nThe rest of the story can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Flight&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Flight&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n\nNOTE:  These scans are NOT my own.
