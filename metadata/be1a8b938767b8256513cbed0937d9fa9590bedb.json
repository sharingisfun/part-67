Released in 1990, it is a recording of the band's show at the Santa Barbara County Bowl in May 1990 during their &quot;Seeds of Love&quot; World Tour.\nThe performance also features American vocalist/pianist Oleta Adams who had worked with the band on their album The Seeds Of Love and joined them for the subsequent world tour.\nGoing to California was initially released on VHS home video and Laserdisc, and was later released on DVD in 2005 as an &quot;extra feature&quot; on the band's Scenes from the Big Chair documentary DVD, complete with an updated 5.1 soundtrack audio option.\nIt was re-released (by itself) on DVD in 2009 as Tears for Fears - Live from Santa Barbara, which featured twelve of the tracks (the original 1990 release had sixteen). An audio CD version was also released simultaneously under the same title.\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Women of Ireland&quot; (instrumental)\n&quot;I Believe&quot; (performed by Oleta Adams)\n&quot;Head Over Heels&quot; / &quot;Broken&quot;\n&quot;Change&quot;\n&quot;Pale Shelter&quot;\n&quot;Woman in Chains&quot;\n&quot;Advice for the Young at Heart&quot;\n&quot;Mad World&quot;\n&quot;Famous Last Words&quot; / &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot;\n&quot;I've Got to Sing My Song&quot; (performed by Oleta Adams)\n&quot;Badman's Song&quot;\n&quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love&quot;\n&quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;\n&quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot;\n&quot;Year of the Knife&quot;\n&quot;Shout&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be1a8b938767b8256513cbed0937d9fa9590bedb","amp;dn":"Tears+for+fears+-+Going+to+California+1990+xvid+Vhsrip+-Phantom.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be1a8b938767b8256513cbed0937d9fa9590bedb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,26,139,147,135,103,184,37,101,19,203,237,9,55,217,250,149,144,190,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
