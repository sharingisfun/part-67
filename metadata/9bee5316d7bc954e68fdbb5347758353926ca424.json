It was originally a play, but the German moviemakers cinematize it with a fluid camera and strange angles.\n\nThe story deals with an encounter between a strange cop and a flaky woman - he suspects her of murdering her children, she is distraught over their deaths. This is really a mood-pece, don't expect the official story to make too much sense. This is about two anguished people trying to relate to each other. The movie is quite daring to make a full feature with only two actors.\n\nWriter Beth B is someone I don't know much about, but apparently she was acive in the underground art scene - maybe pirates know more about her.\n\nThis s my first offering in mkv format - let me know if it works.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bee5316d7bc954e68fdbb5347758353926ca424","amp;dn":"Two+Small+Bodies+%281993%29+Beth+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bee5316d7bc954e68fdbb5347758353926ca424","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,238,83,22,215,188,149,78,104,253,187,83,71,117,131,83,146,108,164,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
