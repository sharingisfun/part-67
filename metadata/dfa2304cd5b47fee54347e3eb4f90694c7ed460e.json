We are influenced by all sorts of bands but the ones who come through prevalently in their songs thus far are Thrice, MuteMath, Minus the Bear, Radiohead, and Incubus.\n\nThe band consists of Tyler Demorest, Matt Cohen, Danny Schnair, and Teddy Boldt. They have all been in their fair share of bands and have used that experience to approach Kiven in a very organized, mature manner.\n\nWe focus on the songs and how we can share those songs with the masses. It starts with getting a good recording, but the backbone of music is the live experience. We spend a lot of time preparing for our shows to keep crowds interested. Thanks for your support, we really appreciate it.\n\nTracklist:\n1. Release\n2. On Through\n3. Fires and Frames\n4. The Blur Ensues\n5. The Irony\n6.
