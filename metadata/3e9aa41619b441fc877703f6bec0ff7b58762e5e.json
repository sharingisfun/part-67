The Digital Video \nBroadcasting has adopted the Tiresias Screenfont as the standard font for the \nMultimedia Home Platform, which many set-top box and digital TV \nmanufacturers are using as their standard development platform. \n \nThe Tiresias Screenfont includes characters that are easy to distinguish from \none another. Throughout the design process, the key factors that affect \nlegibility were studied. \n \nThis font has met with widespread approval. The design team is confident \nthat this new typeface brings considerable improvement to the legibility of \ntext on screens.\n\n\n\nThis font is used all over the world for tv and film subtitling and can cost up $ 17,000.\n\nThis is the latest version of the font.\n\nVersion: 8.04","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e9aa41619b441fc877703f6bec0ff7b58762e5e","amp;dn":"Tiresias+Screenfont+-+Vleermuisman1995","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e9aa41619b441fc877703f6bec0ff7b58762e5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,154,164,22,25,180,65,252,135,119,3,246,190,192,255,123,88,118,46,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
