For Riverside, the Staples recorded mostly gospel but the shouting was toned down a bit. A few modern-day &quot;message&quot; songs make their way into their repertoire as well, including Bob Dylan's &quot;Masters of War.&quot; Not quite as cataclysmic as their Vee-Jay material but still essential.'' ~Rob Bowman (Allmusic)\n\n01.
