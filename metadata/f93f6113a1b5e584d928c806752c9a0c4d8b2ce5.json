One valid key is included.\n\nThe game was originally released in May, 2005, and no one ever came up with a working keygen to defeat the protection on this game.\n\nI would tell you to buy the game if you like it but I wasn't thrilled with Supreme Ruler 2020 or the newest one.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f93f6113a1b5e584d928c806752c9a0c4d8b2ce5","amp;dn":"Supreme+Ruler+2010+4.61","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f93f6113a1b5e584d928c806752c9a0c4d8b2ce5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,63,97,19,161,181,229,132,217,40,200,6,117,44,154,12,77,139,44,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
