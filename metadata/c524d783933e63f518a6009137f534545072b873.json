Just flick your wrist to cast.\n\nOver 4 million downloads! Try this exciting 3D fishing game available only on Android! Enjoy beautiful panoramic views and stunning 3D graphics.\n\nAs you move your phone, the games view changes so you feel like you're really there. Realistic 3D fish can be seen swimming beneath the waves when they are close and will often jump to give away their location when farther away. When you see a big one just flick your wrist to cast. Pull back on your phone to hook a fish and fight it as you reel in your catch. After you catch a fish you can take a picture to view later or share with friends!\n\nThe Lite version includes the first two locations in the game. Please note that the video for the game shows some locations from the full version.\n\nPermissions:\nBig Sport Fishing requires the READ_PHONE_STATE permission. This permission allows access to phone calls but we don't use it for this purpose. This permission is needed to get the device id which is required by certain third party SDKs we have integrated with. These SDKs only use the device id to tell different phones apart. Please contact us if you have any concerns about the permissions required by the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c524d783933e63f518a6009137f534545072b873","amp;dn":"Big+Sport+Fishing+3D+BETA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c524d783933e63f518a6009137f534545072b873","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,36,215,131,147,62,99,245,24,166,0,145,55,245,52,84,80,114,184,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
