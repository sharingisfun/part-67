Her destiny was mirrored in a simple act at an early age. The little girl, who was already often called a songbird, was recorded singing, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jesus Loves MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at the age of 2. BeckahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother was raised in a traditional Jewish home, and her conversion to Christianity was a crucial element in guiding Beckah to her own faith and witness through music. She would need that assurance of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love in the coming years.\n\nBlessings,\nTorrentTracts - September 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90a96c781b3fb11a40023c561e1f027621714510","amp;dn":"Beckah+Shae+Discography+2006-2012+%288+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90a96c781b3fb11a40023c561e1f027621714510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,169,108,120,27,63,177,26,64,2,60,86,30,31,2,118,33,113,69,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
