It's a convenient tool to get a quick orientation of your night sky!\n\nIf you have a new smart phone, you'll presumably have a gyroscope sensor in it. Planet finder + makes use of this sensor (in combination with your accelerometer and magnetometer). This implies that planet finder + responds quickly to your movements and provides you with stable image and accurate readings!\n\nThe application can be installed on the phone sd card in order to save phone storage.\n(open settings -&gt; programs -&gt; manage programs -&gt; PlanetFinder+ -&gt; move to sd)\n\n\n\n                                  By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:937df618319b54f0fcbc3be3092edc35f5cd1db4","amp;dn":"Planet+Finder+%2B+v2.3+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"937df618319b54f0fcbc3be3092edc35f5cd1db4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,125,246,24,49,155,84,240,252,188,59,227,9,46,220,53,245,205,29,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
