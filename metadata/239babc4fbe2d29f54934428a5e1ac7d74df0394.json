Medical cannabis entrepreneur and Fort Collins dispensary owner Josh Stanley works aggressively to counter such pressure with radio ads and fund-raisers. As the oldest of 11 kids, Josh relies heavily on several of his brothers to work at the grove and keep his business supplied in medical marijuana. Meanwhile, Sgt. Jim Gerhardt and fellow officers on the North Metro Task Force continue to find illegal grows by residents claiming to be growing medical marijuana. Is the pendulum swinging back to curb the ten-year proliferation of medical marijuana in Colorado?\n\n\n1)  Green Rush \nIn Denver, growers compete in Colorado's inaugural High Times Medical Cannabis Cup. Elsewhere, a Boulder family struggle to meet Colorado's stringent guidelines after opening their first grow house and dispensary; and a 16-year-old with a rare disorder finds marijuana to be a uniquely effective cure.\n\n2)  Rocky Mountain Medicine \nDenver agents go undercover to arrest illegal cannabis sellers. Plus, a man hunts for the cash to finance ground- breaking research into medical marijuana.\n\n3)  4 - 20 or Bust \nAs a cult holiday for marijuana, April 20th is the buzz in Colorado. Members of the De Noue family put their resources toward turning their failing business around , and 64-year-old cancer patient Anne Marie finds herself in the middle of her towns fight to ban her green medicine.\n\n4)  Banned and Busted \nWhile people like pink-mohawked cancer patient Josh Belt use medical marijuana to deal with their health problems, cannabis also proves controversial as an upcoming vote threatens to shut down the only dispensary in the town of Castle Rock, Colorado, and North Boulder Wellness Centers manager Alex Douglas, fed up with his employers, decides to quit and move to Aspen.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/6484/milehighshowdownscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/6484/milehighshowdownscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img88.imageshack.us/img88/1999/milehighshowdownscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img88.imageshack.us/img88/1999/milehighshowdownscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/5851/milehighshowdownscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/5851/milehighshowdownscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/3627/milehighshowdownscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/3627/milehighshowdownscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/1756/milehighshowdownscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/1756/milehighshowdownscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/2575/milehighshowdownscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/2575/milehighshowdownscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/5627/milehighshowdownscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/5627/milehighshowdownscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img211.imageshack.us/img211/2521/milehighshowdownscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img211.imageshack.us/img211/2521/milehighshowdownscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img528.imageshack.us/img528/1347/milehighshowdownscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img528.imageshack.us/img528/1347/milehighshowdownscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2044 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 45.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/american-weed/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/american-weed/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:239babc4fbe2d29f54934428a5e1ac7d74df0394","amp;dn":"NG+American+Weed+Mile+High+Showdown+2of4+Rocky+Mountain+Medicine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"239babc4fbe2d29f54934428a5e1ac7d74df0394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,155,171,196,251,226,210,159,84,147,68,40,165,225,172,125,116,223,3,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
