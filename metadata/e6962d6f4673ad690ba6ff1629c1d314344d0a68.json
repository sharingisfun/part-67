Work has been devalued. Education costs are out of sight. Effort and ambition have never been so scantily rewarded. Political guru James Carville and pollster extraordinaire Stan Greenberg argue that our political parties must admit their failures and the electorate must reclaim its voice, because taking on the wealthy and the privileged is not class warfareÃ¢â‚¬â€it is a matter of survival. Told in the alternating voices of these two top political strategists, ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Middle Class, Stupid! provides eye-opening and provocative arguments on where our governmentÃ¢â‚¬â€including the White HouseÃ¢â‚¬â€has gone wrong, and what voters can do about it. \n\nControversial and outspoken, authoritative and shrewd, ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Middle Class, Stupid! is destined to make waves during the 2012 presidential campaign, and will set the agenda for legislative battles and political dust-ups during the next administration.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6962d6f4673ad690ba6ff1629c1d314344d0a68","amp;dn":"It%27s+the+Middle+Class%2C+Stupid.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6962d6f4673ad690ba6ff1629c1d314344d0a68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,150,45,111,70,115,173,105,11,166,255,22,41,193,211,20,52,77,10,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
