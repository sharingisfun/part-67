[and as] rooted deep down in his being as the mystic.His term the &quot;new man&quot; applied to men and women equally, whose roles he saw as complementary; indeed, most of his movement's leadership positions were held by women.This new man, &quot;Zorba the Buddha&quot;, should reject neither science nor spirituality but embrace both.[162] Osho believed humanity was threatened with extinction due to over-population, impending nuclear holocaust and diseases such as AIDS, and thought many of society's ills could be remedied by scientific means.The new man would no longer be trapped in institutions such as family, marriage, political ideologies and religions. In this respect Osho is similar to other counter-culture gurus, and perhaps even certain postmodern and deconstructional thinkers.\n\nOsho's &quot;Ten Commandments&quot;\n\nIn his early days as Acharya Rajneesh, a correspondent once asked Osho for his &quot;Ten Commandments&quot;. In reply Osho noted that it was a difficult matter because he was against any kind of commandment but, &quot;just for fun&quot;, set out the following;Ã¢â‚¬Å“\t\n\n1-Never obey anyone's command unless it is coming from within you.\n2-There is no God other than life itself.\n3-Truth is within you, do not search for it elsewhere.\n4-Love is prayer.\n5-To become a nothingness is the door to truth. Nothingness itself is the means, the goal and attainment.\n6-Life is now and here.\n7-Live wakefully.\n8-Do not swimÃ¢â‚¬â€float.\n9-Die each moment so that you can be new each moment.\n10-Do not search. That which is, is. Stop and see.\tÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nHe underlined numbers 3, 7, 9 and 10.[193] The ideas expressed in these Commandments have remained constant leitmotifs in his movement.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagwan_Shree_Rajneesh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagwan_Shree_Rajneesh&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:871973849137f33abe8064b9c86621aac5f10fdb","amp;dn":"OSHO-Never+obey+anyone%27s+command+unless+it+is+coming+from+within","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"871973849137f33abe8064b9c86621aac5f10fdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,25,115,132,145,55,243,58,190,128,100,185,200,102,33,170,197,241,15,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
