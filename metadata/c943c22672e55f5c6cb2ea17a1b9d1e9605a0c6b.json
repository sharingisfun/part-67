Until Fowke began collecting these in the 1950Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s, most had never been heard by a general audience. Though a large portion of the songs on this recording come from the Irish-Canadians of the Peterborough region, many other songs trace their influence back to American and British roots. These stirring compositions cover everything from lumber-jacking to murdering to the married life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c943c22672e55f5c6cb2ea17a1b9d1e9605a0c6b","amp;dn":"Folk+Songs+Of+Ontario","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c943c22672e55f5c6cb2ea17a1b9d1e9605a0c6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,67,194,38,114,229,95,92,108,178,234,23,161,185,209,233,96,90,12,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
