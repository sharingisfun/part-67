Miyamoto Konatsu is a positive-thinking girl who loves singing and spends time after school at the vocal music club. Okita Sawa is a spirited archery club member who dreams of becoming a horse rider. Tanaka Taichi is a chronically late badminton team member who lives with his college student sister. Wien just transfered into Wakana's class after 12 years abroad in Austria.
