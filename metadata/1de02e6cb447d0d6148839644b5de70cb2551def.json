In 1947, the sub continent became India, East (now Bangladesh) and West Pakistan (today's Pakistan). The series pretended to keep memories and truths about the partition alive, at a time when many Indians and Pakistanis seemed to be forgetting this historical tragedy. The film is based on the book by Brisham Sahni, himself a refugee to India from West Punjab, now in Pakistan. Thus fittingly, this epic looks at Partition from an Indian Punjabi perspective, as the fate of Sikh and Hindu families in West Punjab is emphasized. The first part also underscores the Muslim viewpoint: the provocations they suffered from Sikhs and especially Hindus... \n\n\nDirector: Govind Nihalani\n\nMusic Director: Vanraj Bhatia\n\nStory: Bhisham Sahni\nCountry: India\nLanguage: Hindi\nYear: 1986\nVideo: Xvid 320x240 25.00fps [Stream 00]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 96kbps [Stream 01]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1de02e6cb447d0d6148839644b5de70cb2551def","amp;dn":"TAMAS-Darkness-1986-Hindi-VHSRip-XviD-By+AB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1de02e6cb447d0d6148839644b5de70cb2551def","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,224,46,108,180,71,208,214,20,136,57,100,75,93,231,12,178,85,29,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
