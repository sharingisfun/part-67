Desperate for actual leads, Mickey and his partner Asia (A.J. Khan), assemble a team to lead them to the actual creature. The team composed of Billie (Allison Whitney), Pauline (Danielle Donahue), Curly (Ian Piper) and Drew (Jared Warren), goes off to local resident, CletusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Ken Van Sant), cabin to await the arrival of the Muckman.
