His marriage has lost its spark, his job is suffocating him, and his childhood best friend Dan still clings to the past. Every day he goes through the motions, becoming increasingly detached from those around him. Dan thinks he has the solution, a mysterious video TomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got to see to believeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ tonight. What Dan shows him leaves Tom unsettled, flooding his mind with disturbing images and desires, and binding the two friends together with its ugly secret. One video soon follows another and another, blurring the line between reality and voyeuristic fascination, and threatening to dismantle everything around them. \n\nGenre: Drama | Horror | Thriller \nIMDB Rating: 5.6/10 \nDirected by: Elias \nStarring: Jason Vail, Nicholas Wilder and Sarah Schoofs \n\nRelease Name: GUT.2012.DVDRiP.AC3.XViD-NoGRP \nSize: 796 MB \nVideo: XviD, 640 x 360, 1034 kb/s \nAudio: English, AC3, 192 kb/s \nRuntime: 1.30.08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12d6ac99a9898d28a175ef4147bfb340a4e9a133","amp;dn":"GUT.2012.DVDRiP.XViD-NoGRP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12d6ac99a9898d28a175ef4147bfb340a4e9a133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,214,172,153,169,137,141,40,161,117,239,65,71,191,179,64,164,233,161,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
