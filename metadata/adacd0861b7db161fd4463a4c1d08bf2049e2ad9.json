These institutions share a common ideology. They aggressively promote &quot;corporate&quot; capitalism, neoliberalism, giving free rein to the interests of a small number of transnational corporations. This book presents the history and fundamental ideas of this economic ideology. Describing each member of the &quot;unholy trinity,&quot; it shows how neoliberalism hijacked the IMF, World Bank and WTO in relation to their global financial, development and trade management roles.\n\nPublisher: Zed Books (November 29, 2003)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 184277073X\nISBN-13: 978-1842770733\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adacd0861b7db161fd4463a4c1d08bf2049e2ad9","amp;dn":"Richard_Peet-Unholy_Trinity__The_IMF%2C_World_Bank_and_WTO%2C_Second","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adacd0861b7db161fd4463a4c1d08bf2049e2ad9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,172,208,134,27,125,177,97,253,68,99,164,193,208,139,242,4,158,42,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
