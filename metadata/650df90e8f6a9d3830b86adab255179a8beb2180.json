For those of us who have discovered him, he's given us a soundtrack to our misgivings about the world that still leaves room for hope. It's the kind of sound we can believe in, one that provides a backseat to the low rumblings in the back of our minds and a steady march to help us find our way back home. I wish program managers had their finger on the pulse enough to follow artist like Angie Aparo.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-Sean Gilbert\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nAlbums included: \n\nEl Primero Del Tres\t\t(2006)\n9Live\t\t\t\t(2004)\nFor Stars And Moon\t\t(2003)\nWeapon Of Mass Construction\t(2001)\nThe American\t\t\t(1999)\nOut Of Everywhere\t\t(1996)\n\nCodec:\t\tApple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)\nFile Format:\tApple MPEG-4 Audio (.m4a)\nBit Rate:\tVBR\nSample Rate:\t44.100kHz\nChannels:\tStereo\nSample Size:\t16 bit\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nAngie Aparo official website\t-\thttp://www.angieaparo.com/\nLive Angie Aparo music archive\t-\thttp://archive.org/details/AngieAparo\nMyspace\t\t\t\t-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:650df90e8f6a9d3830b86adab255179a8beb2180","amp;dn":"Angie+Aparo+-+Partial+Discography+%28Lossless+Format%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"650df90e8f6a9d3830b86adab255179a8beb2180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,13,249,14,143,106,157,56,48,184,106,218,178,85,23,154,139,235,33,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
