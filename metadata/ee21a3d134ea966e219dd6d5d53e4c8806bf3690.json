Not only has the sound quality been dramatically improved by the exquisite re-mastering of Rich Nevins, but more great material has been added, featuring such intriguing artists as the Grinnell Giggers, and Hinman &amp; Sharp. There is a wealth here of some of the loveliest and most distinctive rural music ever put on record. Suffice it to say any fan of old-time music will find much to enjoy in this wonderful collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee21a3d134ea966e219dd6d5d53e4c8806bf3690","amp;dn":"Echoes+Of+The+Ozarks+Vol.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee21a3d134ea966e219dd6d5d53e4c8806bf3690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,33,163,209,52,234,150,110,33,157,214,213,213,62,76,136,6,191,54,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
