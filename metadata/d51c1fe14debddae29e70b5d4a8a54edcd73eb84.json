Lemon miso soup. Harvest lasagna, lentil walnut burgers, and ginger molasses cookies. Veteran Minneapolis chef Jenny Breen knows that cooking at home can be a joyful, rewarding, and healthy experience for the whole family. In Cooking Up the Good Life, Jenny BreenÃ¢â‚¬â€along with local writer and photographer Susan ThurstonÃ¢â‚¬â€presents a scrumptious journey through the seasonal ingredients of the upper Midwest with an enticing variety of her most-loved recipes for the family table.\n\nWritten with both beginner and experienced cooks in mind, each section in Cooking Up the Good LifeÃ¢â‚¬â€from starters and sauces to soups, salads, main courses, and sweetsÃ¢â‚¬â€is organized by season to help bring our daily meals into harmony with local harvests. Recipes include imaginative Ã¢â‚¬Å“Family KitchenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ segments that suggest safe, fun ways to get kids involved. An advocate for inviting children into the kitchen, Breen has found that they are more apt to eat what they are connected to, whether by growing the vegetables, feeding the chickens and collecting the eggs, or helping prepare the food.\n\nCooking at home is also an opportunity to discover more about the ingredients we use and the people who bring them to our grocery stores, our farmers markets, and ultimately to our tables. Featuring refreshingly simple, creative, and unfussy recipes, Cooking Up the Good LifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relaxed and encouraging style helps you cook with ease and serve with confidence wholesome dishes that highlight the natural beauty and elegance of Midwestern seasonal ingredients. Oh, yesÃ¢â‚¬â€and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re absolutely delicious. But donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just take our word for it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d51c1fe14debddae29e70b5d4a8a54edcd73eb84","amp;dn":"Creative+Recipes+for+the+Family+Table.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d51c1fe14debddae29e70b5d4a8a54edcd73eb84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,28,31,225,77,235,221,174,41,231,11,93,74,138,84,237,205,115,235,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
