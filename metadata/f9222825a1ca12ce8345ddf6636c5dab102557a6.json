I frankly can't even believe I'm sharing it. In my opinion, this is truly the holy grail of Toto bootlegs for 3 reasons. First, the sound quality is so perfect it could even pass for an official release. The mix is amazing, with soaring highs and a fantastic bottom end....every instrument is completely audible. Second, the performance is more passionate and inspired than any other Toto show I've ever heard (and I've heard many) . There was another version of this show circulating for a while with inferior sound quality, but \nthis version blows that away as it is without question, directly from the master tape. Third, this is what many Toto fans (including myself) would call the definitive lineup.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9222825a1ca12ce8345ddf6636c5dab102557a6","amp;dn":"Toto+-+1987-02-04+-+Paris%2C+France++SBD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9222825a1ca12ce8345ddf6636c5dab102557a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,34,40,37,161,202,18,206,131,69,221,246,99,108,93,171,16,37,87,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
