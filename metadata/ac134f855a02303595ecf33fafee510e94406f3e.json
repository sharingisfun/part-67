The crew of the Solar System Shipping shipping vessel number 17 runs in shifts. When the second shift awakens from hyper-sleep almost ten months after their scheduled time, they find the ship badly damaged, off course, and missing the first shift. What's more, it's discovered the first shift killed each other. As the plot unfolds, something truly evil is discovered on-board.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac134f855a02303595ecf33fafee510e94406f3e","amp;dn":"Alien+Cargo+%281999%29+%28VHSRip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac134f855a02303595ecf33fafee510e94406f3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,19,79,133,90,2,48,53,149,236,243,63,175,238,81,14,148,64,111,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
