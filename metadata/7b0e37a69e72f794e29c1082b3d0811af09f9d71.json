Born in Gadara in Syria, Philodemus (ca. 110-40 BCE) was active in Italy as an Epicurean philosopher and poet. This volume comprises three parts; the first deals with PhilodemusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ works in their own terms, the second situates his thought within its larger Greco-Roman context, and the third explores the implications of his work for understanding the earliest Christians, especially Paul. It will be useful to all readers interested in Hellenistic philosophy and rhetoric as well as Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity. \n\n\nPdf: 434 pages\nPublisher: Brill Academic Pub; 1St Edition edition (December 2003)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9004114602","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b0e37a69e72f794e29c1082b3d0811af09f9d71","amp;dn":"Philodemus+and+the+New+Testament+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b0e37a69e72f794e29c1082b3d0811af09f9d71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,14,55,166,158,114,247,148,226,156,16,130,179,208,129,26,240,159,157,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
