The series concentrated on notorious murders carried out during the 20th century. \n\nIn the beginning of each show a particularly infamous crime would be examined as an example. The words Ã¢â‚¬Å“Infamous Murders now examinesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ would follow and the other three murders would be presented.\n\nThe series relied on historical documents for visuals rather than reenactments.
