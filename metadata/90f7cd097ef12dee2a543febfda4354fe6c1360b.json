This is New Orleans Brass Band music in rare form. Informal. A bit ragged (NOT a bad thing) at times. Great ensemble improv. It's live and honest on the street level. It's what you would hear if you were in the ''Second Line'' in a procession. I love this CD. ''Hey man, there goes Harold Dejean!'' And the (now deceased) Duke Dejean says, ''I want to leave you wit dis, 'everything is lovely.' '' This whole CD &quot;is lovely.&quot; We miss you, Duke!~Alan B. Borne\n\nThis group is fantastic, lots of energy and great grooves. At times the musicianship is a bit off, but the infectious beat and syncopation make it a joy to behold. My only real complaint about the CD is that it's only 39 minutes long. Even in the days of LP records this would be bit of a skimpy collection...4 more songs and I'd give it 5 stars.~Ken Miller\n\n01. Mardi Gras In New Orleans\t  \n02. Olympia On Parade\t  \n03.
