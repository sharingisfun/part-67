This image is compressed to a 7z file and then split into (7) 650MB 7z files.\n\nNOTE: This image installs slow on VMware. It is NOT a bad image. Have patience and eventually the installation will begin on VMware. I don't know why id does that but I can assure you this .iso does work so please don't post &quot;bad image&quot; or any thing of the sort until you give it a shot. \n\nAlso, once you get it working please purchase the OS from the Apple App Store. Don't be the one to ruin it for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f1e655f3bfe17e6c7bb23c736a257e011fc4227","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+X+Lion+10.7.4+Retail+.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f1e655f3bfe17e6c7bb23c736a257e011fc4227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,30,101,95,59,254,23,230,199,187,35,199,54,162,87,224,17,252,66,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
