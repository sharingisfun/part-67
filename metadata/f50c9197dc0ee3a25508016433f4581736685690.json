You might assume nukes, or genetically altered chimps are the culprit. Wrong you are. This time around what did us in was -- Books!  How did this happen? It of course is not explained. But it was books, you sure can count on that!\n\nSo the Warriors of the Wasteland drive around in their admittedly sweet cars, sporting their admittedly heinous hairstyles, kinda resenting books and occasionally massacring an outpost of survivors. \n\nBooks may have caused the apocalypse, but laughable special effects and ludicrous dialogue certainly survived it. Please join Mike, Kevin, Bill and a bunch of folks who couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afford tickets to Thunderdome for Warriors of the Wasteland.\n\n----------------\n\nEditor's note: This was much more work than I anticipated. MP3 audio was lifted directly from the Rifftrax video, while the XVID picture was significantly edited from the DVD rip of &quot;The New Barbarians&quot; (The original English title). Only one riff at the end was deleted -- &quot;Things like consistent aspect ratios are so main-stream Hollywood&quot; since there is now no change in the aspect ratio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f50c9197dc0ee3a25508016433f4581736685690","amp;dn":"RIFFTRAX+-+Warriors+Of+The+Wasteland+WIDESCREEN+VERSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f50c9197dc0ee3a25508016433f4581736685690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,12,145,151,220,14,227,162,85,8,1,100,51,244,88,23,54,104,86,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
