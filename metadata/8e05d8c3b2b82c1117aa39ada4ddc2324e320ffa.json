See music samples.\n\nThe only disappointing thing was the inadequate cutting of the songs in the original recording. The \nbeginning of most songs (in 80%) was left in previous tracks. I had to correct it by the transfer of \nthe end of some tracks to the beginning of the next ones. Also I split 3 tracks containing two songs \ninto individual ones (Sound forge 8 + FlacFrontend were used).  \n\n\n01. Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting  \n02. I'm Still Standing  \n03. Levon  \n04. Madman Across the Water  \n05. Holiday Inn  \n06. Tiny Dancer  \n07. Philadelphia Freedom  \n08. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road  \n09. Candle in the Wind  \n10. Rocket Man  \n11. I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues  \n12. Hey Ahab  \n13. Gone to Shiloh  \n14. Monkey Suit  \n15. Band Introduction\n16. Sacrifice  \n17. Honky Cat  \n18. Sad Songs (Say So Much)  \n19. Daniel  \n20. Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word  \n21. Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me  \n22. The Bitch Is Back  \n23. Are You Ready for Love  \n24. Bennie and the Jets  \n25. Crocodile Rock  \n\n***ENCORE***\n26. Your Song  \n27. Nikita\n\nOverall running time: 02:31:48\n\n----------------------------------------\nPlease Try to keep the quality of this show...
