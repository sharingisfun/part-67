Holmes, Marcin Klonowicz and Adam 'Ender' Waclawski during last months of post production. We asked them to do something that will help bring up the mood of the movie, but on the same time stay in the background. We were amazed about the final result. Some of the tracks available below were not used in the movie, but all of them are part of the creative process around HIDDEN and we decided that they should be a part of this soundtrack. \n\nYou are free to download it and share it with others for free, or redistribute it in any not profitable way!

This is my first torrent, so if something will be wrong please let me know in the comments.\n\n==================================\n\nThere are strange things going on in an old factory complex somewhere in Russia.
