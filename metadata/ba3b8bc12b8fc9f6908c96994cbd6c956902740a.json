Gain access to the full season [5 episodes] of The Walking Dead by purchasing the Season Pass, your gateway to a dark and emotional season where every decision and action can result in the entire story of the game changing around you. Updates will automatically be downloaded and the in-game menu will act as your gateway to accessing all of the episodes as they are released.\nPlay as Lee Everett, a convicted criminal, who has been given a second chance at life in a world devastated by the undead. With corpses returning to life and survivors stopping at nothing to maintain their own safety, protecting an orphaned girl named Clementine may offer him redemption in a world gone to hell.\n\n\nThis is a fully automated update from my previous version &quot;The Walking Dead Episode 1&quot;. So no need to re-play the game. As long as you have my version you can update to Episode 2 instantly. I've slimmed down the file size to 998MB (as small as I can get it). \n\nNote: You can only use this if you have my copy of The Walking Dead Episode 1.\nDon't have it yet? You can grab a copy right here on TPB \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7231181/Walking_Dead_Episode_1_MAC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7231181/Walking_Dead_Episode_1_MAC&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRemember to read the instructions before use!\n\nHappy Hacking!\n-AppRipper\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba3b8bc12b8fc9f6908c96994cbd6c956902740a","amp;dn":"Walking+Dead+Episode+2+%28Update%29+%28MAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba3b8bc12b8fc9f6908c96994cbd6c956902740a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,59,139,193,43,143,201,246,144,140,150,153,76,189,108,149,105,2,116,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
