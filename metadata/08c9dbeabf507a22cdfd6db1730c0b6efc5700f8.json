She'd be a lot like Kate Connor, once a demon/vampire/zombie killer and now &quot;a glorified chauffeur for drill-team practice and Gymboree play dates&quot; in San Diablo, Calif., that's what. But in Kenner's sprightly, fast-paced ode to kick-ass housewives, Kate finds herself battling evil once again. First a demon tries to kill Kate while she's making rigatoni for an important dinner party that her sweet second husband, Stuart, has scheduledÃ¢â‚¬â€at the last possible minuteÃ¢â‚¬â€to butter up potential allies in his run for county attorney. Kate dispatches the demon handily enough, but she learns that Goramesh, one of the terrible High Demons, has come to town looking for something. Where's he hiding and what does he want? Can she defeat him without exposing her past to StuartÃ¢â‚¬â€and without putting two-year-old Timmy in day care? Though Kenner starts off her story by dropping so many brand names the book reads like a how-to manual for product placement, she settles down to the action soon enough, and readers will find spunky Kate hard not to root for in spheres both domestic and demonic.

So while doing what supermoms do -- raising an inquisitive two-year old, dealing with a teenage girl's myriad of social issues, supporting an overworked husband running for county attorney, etc. -- Kate also finds time to unravel the mystery behind the sudden ghoulish invasion. It seems a master demon named Goramesh has come to town in search of an invaluable religious artifact secreted in a much-storied cathedral. But in order to obtain the relic, Goramesh must first find a suitable human subordinate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08c9dbeabf507a22cdfd6db1730c0b6efc5700f8","amp;dn":"Julie+Kenner+-+Carpe+Demon+%5BV8%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08c9dbeabf507a22cdfd6db1730c0b6efc5700f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,201,219,234,191,80,122,34,205,253,109,177,115,12,11,110,252,87,0,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
