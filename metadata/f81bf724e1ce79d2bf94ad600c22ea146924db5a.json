At a club, she finds just that in happily-partying Lloyd Buist (Adam Sinclair), a drug addict. Heather falls hard for Lloyd despite the fact that most of their time spent together is under the influence of illicit substances. As they experiment with this new lifestyle, they are faced with the question of whether they love their drugs, each other, or are just drugged into loving each other. The romantic storyline is supplemented by a side plot involving Lloyd owing money to a shady character, Solo (Carlo Rota). While Lloyd is out of control with drugs and left unchecked, he must fulfill his karmic debt with Solo. After a while, Heather begins to doubt the veracity of Lloyd's feelings for her, wondering if it might not be the effect of the drugs after all. When Lloyd almost dies after a drug smuggling operation goes terribly wrong and faces the possibility of losing Heather, he decides to turn his life around, and he finds that natural highs might be the best of all. He wants to change, but first must deal with Solo.\n\nMEDIAINFO\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 4 551 Kbps\nLength            : 3.29 GiB for 1h 43mn 34s 175ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 4 099 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 24.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\n\n\nmy sample on youtube\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f81bf724e1ce79d2bf94ad600c22ea146924db5a","amp;dn":"Irvine+Welshes+Ecstasy+2011-720p-BDRip+-x264+Ac3+5.1.mp4.-winker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f81bf724e1ce79d2bf94ad600c22ea146924db5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,27,247,36,225,206,121,210,191,148,173,96,12,34,234,20,105,36,219,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
