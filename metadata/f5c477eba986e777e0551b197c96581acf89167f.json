In the middle of the Ohio primary, the campaign manager of Morris's opponent asks Meyers to meet; he offers him a job. At the same time, Morris's negotiations for the endorsement of the man in third place, a North Carolina Senator, hit a snag. A young campaign intern, Molly Stearns, gets Stephen's romantic attention. Republicans have a trick up their sleeve; Stephen may be too trusting, and Molly has a secret. What's most important, career, victory, or virtue?\n\n\n\nGreetings Realuploads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5c477eba986e777e0551b197c96581acf89167f","amp;dn":"The+Ides+of+March+%28+Nordic+subs+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5c477eba986e777e0551b197c96581acf89167f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,196,119,235,169,134,231,119,224,85,27,25,124,150,88,26,207,137,22,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
