The MPG specs, then, are here, and can be copied from my post to apply to the proper files.  My apologies, but I did not want to miss posting them.  Please enjoy!\n\nGullivers Travels (1996) Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, Peter OToole, Omar Sharif, Alfre Woodard\n\nAn Englishman returns after a long time abroad and tells his strange stories about the lands he visited which are allegories about the real world.  Danson is excellent in this role, making one believe in his character throughout.\nI also have the mpg version, 6 Gb total (two times 3 Gb), at 29 fps. This is much smoother with better crispness, and I will u-l it if there is any interest. \n\n\nF I L E  I N F O\n\nTITLE............GulliverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Travels\nYEAR.............1996\nGENRE............Adventure / drama\nRUNTIME..........3 hrs. 7 min. combined \nIMDB URL......... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115195/\n\nAUDIO............224 Kbs (2 chnls) 48 kHz sampling rate\nVIDEO............6000 Kb/s AVI type 29.000 FPS\nFORMAT...........DIVX / MP3\nLANGUAGE.........English\nRESOLUTION.......720 x 480\nFILES............2\nSIZE.............Part One 2.95 Gb (3,169,388,544 bytes) \n                 Part Two 2.84 Gb (3,050,450,944 bytes)\nSOURCE...........NTSC VHS tape\n\nN O T E S\n\nCOUNTRY..........USA\nDIRECTOR.........Charles Sturridge\nSCREENWRITER.....Simon Moore\nAuthor...........Jonathan Swift\nCAST.............Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, Peter OToole, Omar Sharif, James Fox\nSTUDIO...........20th Century Fox\n\nDanson portrays Gulliver, the 18th century physician who takes eight event-packed years to return home.
