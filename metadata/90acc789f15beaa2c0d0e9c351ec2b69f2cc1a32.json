Engelhardt offers a savage anatomy of how successive administrations in Washington took the ?Soviet pathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½?pouring American treasure into the military, war, and national security?and so helped drive their country off the nearest cliff.\n\n This is the startling tale of how fear was profitably shot into the national bloodstream, how the country?gripped by terror fantasies?was locked down, and how a brain-dead Washington elite fiddled (and profited) while America quietly burned.\n\n Think of it as the story of how the Cold War really ended, with the triumphalist ?sole superpowerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of 1991 heading slowly for the same exit through which the Soviet Union left the stage twenty years earlier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90acc789f15beaa2c0d0e9c351ec2b69f2cc1a32","amp;dn":"The+United+States+of+Fear.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90acc789f15beaa2c0d0e9c351ec2b69f2cc1a32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,172,199,137,241,91,234,162,192,208,233,195,81,236,43,105,242,204,26,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
