I believe this to be a soundobard instead\nof an FM broadcast because as far as I know they never did \nany FM broadcasts from this tour other than the MTV special.\nOne of the more popular recordings from their 1994 tour, I \nhaven't seen this on DIME yet so I thought I'd share it.\nCouple of things to note: first, on disc 1 the last track has\nboth &quot;Lyin' Eyes&quot; and &quot;One Of These Nights&quot; on it. No idea why \nthese were not plit up, but this is how I got it. These are\noriginal silver CD's BTW, NOT CD-R's. Second, you may be able to\nfit these onto 2 discs - again this is how I got it, on 3 discs\nand so I've never changed it. Third, there is artwork out there.\nI can't upload it but this is a very popular CD so I'm sure a \nlittle searching on the internet and you can find something.\nThis was the set list through-out most of the 1994 and 1995 tour.\nNot too bad - my only complaint was that they played too many of\ntheir solo hits during the second act. I mean, we were there to see\nthe Eagles! They had so many songs - &quot;James Dean&quot;, &quot;The Last Resort&quot;,\n&quot;Ol' 55&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, the list goes on and on. Otherwise, this is\na fantastic recording, it basically speaks for itself, so please rate \nand ENJOY!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:501dde97201df0a9e9133264fe45a56e30cdc018","amp;dn":"Eagles+-+1994-08-24+-+Giants+Stadium+in+E+Rutherford%2C+NJ++SBD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"501dde97201df0a9e9133264fe45a56e30cdc018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,29,222,151,32,29,240,169,233,19,50,100,254,69,165,110,48,205,192,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
