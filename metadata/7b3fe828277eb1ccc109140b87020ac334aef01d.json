The centrepiece of The Weight of the Nation is the 4-part documentary series that features case studies and interviews with experts as well as individuals and families struggling with obesity. Each part focuses on a particular issue: &quot;Consequences,&quot; examines the scope of the obesity epidemic and the serious health consequences of being overweight or obese; &quot;Choices,&quot; reveals the science behind obesity and weight loss; &quot;Children in Crisis,&quot; documents the impact the epidemic is having on the nation's children; and &quot;Challenges,&quot; examines the major forces behind the obesity epidemic.\nParts 5 to 16 are a collection of 12 films ranging in length from 11 to 30minutes each part focuses on a particular issue.\n\n\n1)  Consequences \nThe first film in The Weight of the Nation series examines the scope of the obesity epidemic and explores the serious health consequences of being overweight or obese, including heart disease, the negative impact on liver function and the risks of diabetes. The obesity epidemic is a problem that's emerged over the last 30 years. It threatens our nation's social, economic and physical health. But, unlike a natural disaster, obesity is often preventable. Although overall obesity prevalence rates appear to be leveling off, there are still far too many Americans who are overweight or obese and who continue to develop health problems as a result. In order to end the epidemic, everyone must be part of the solution.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img441.imageshack.us/img441/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img441.imageshack.us/img441/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img268.imageshack.us/img268/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img268.imageshack.us/img268/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img140.imageshack.us/img140/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img140.imageshack.us/img140/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1408 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 224 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 1 - 4 = 67mins\n * RunTime Per Part: 5 - 16 average 11mins - 32mins\n * Number Of Parts: 16\n * Part Size: Parts 1 - 4 = 746 MB\n * Part Size: Parts 5 - 16 = 94 MB - 250 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://theweightofthenation.hbo.com/films&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://theweightofthenation.hbo.com/films&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b3fe828277eb1ccc109140b87020ac334aef01d","amp;dn":"Weight+of+the+Nation+Season+1+01of16+Consequences+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b3fe828277eb1ccc109140b87020ac334aef01d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,63,232,40,39,126,177,204,193,9,20,11,135,2,10,195,52,174,240,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
