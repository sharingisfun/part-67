This gives you insight into circuit operation like no equation does. While simulation is running, adjust circuit parameters with analog knob, and the circuit responds to your actions in real time. You can even generate an arbitrary input signal with your finger!\n\nThat's interactivity and innovation you can't find in best SPICE tools for PC like Multisim, LTspice, OrCad or PSpice (trademarks belong to their respective owners).\n\nEveryCircuit is not just an eye candy. Under the hood it packs custom-built simulation engine optimized for interactive mobile use, serious numerical methods, and realistic device models. In short, Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, nonlinear semiconductor device equations, and all the good stuff is there.\n\nFeatures:\n+ Animations of voltage waveforms and current flows\n+ Analog control knob adjusts circuit parameters\n+ Automatic wire routing\n+ Oscilloscope\n+ Seamless DC and transient simulation\n+ Single play/pause button controls simulation\n+ Saving and loading of circuit schematic\n+ Mobile simulation engine built from ground-up\n+ Shake the phone to kick-start oscillators\n+ Intuitive user interface\n+ No Ads\n\nComponents:\n+ Sources, signal generators\n+ Resistors, capacitors, inductors\n+ Switches, SPST, SPDT\n+ Diodes, Zener diodes, light emitting diodes (LED)\n+ MOS transistors (MOSFET)\n+ Bipolar junction transistors (BJT)\n+ Ideal operational amplifier (opamp)\n+ Digital logic gates, AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR\n\nWhat's in this version:\nAnimation of capacitor charges\nPotentiometer\nLamp\nMore convenient pulse source parameters\nFixed SPDT switch current animation\nFixed pulse source loading from earlier file versions\n\n\n                                   By bobiras2009\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88364c936c2e74899f6f70d5b7cc4e11fc22d23c","amp;dn":"EveryCircuit+Full+v1.13+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88364c936c2e74899f6f70d5b7cc4e11fc22d23c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,54,76,147,108,46,116,137,159,111,112,213,183,204,78,17,252,34,210,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
