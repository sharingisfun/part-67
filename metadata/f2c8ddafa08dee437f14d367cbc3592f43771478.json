And there is one expression that is continuously invoked by the Israeli leadership in order to justify its claims that Iran is an existential threat.\n\nIn the words of Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister: &quot;They are the leaders of Iran who called for a new Holocaust and who vowed to wipe Israel off the map.&quot;\n\nAl Jazeera's Teymoor Nabili talks to Dan Meridor (to the right), Israel's minister of intelligence and atomic energy and deputy prime minister, about this and questions him over Israeli politicians' claims that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian president, said Iran would 'wipe Israel out'.\n\nDuring the interview Meridor admits that in fact, the Iranian leaders had never called for a new &quot;Holocaust&quot; nor did Ahmadinejad ever say that Iran would &quot;wipe Israel out&quot;.\n\n\n&quot;They [Iranian leaders] all come basically ideologically, religiously with the statement that Israel is an unnatural creature, it will not survive,&quot; Meridor says. &quot;They didn't say 'we'll wipe it out', you are right, but 'it will not survive, it is a cancerous tumour, it should be removed'. They repeatedly said 'Israel is not legitimate, it should not exist'.&quot;\n\nOn this episode of Talk to Al Jazeera we analyse the words and issues central to the dispute between Israel and Iran with Israel's deputy prime minister.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2c8ddafa08dee437f14d367cbc3592f43771478","amp;dn":"%26quot%3BThe+Danger+Comes+From+Iran%26quot%3B+2012+AJE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2c8ddafa08dee437f14d367cbc3592f43771478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,200,221,175,160,141,238,67,127,20,211,103,203,195,89,47,67,119,20,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
