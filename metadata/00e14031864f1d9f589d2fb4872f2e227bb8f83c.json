The very first one was at the Punk Illegal festival. The band liked the taste of hardcore again and recorded a new EP trough the fall of 2010 and released a new 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in December 2010 with five new songs. \n\nDuring the fall of 2011 E.A.T.E.R. went to Amerika with the Doomsday Troops for a two week tour of the North East of the United States!
