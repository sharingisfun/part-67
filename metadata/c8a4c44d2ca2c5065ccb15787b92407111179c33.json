I shot the video with Panasonic HDC-SD90 and audio with Edirol R-09HR + CA-14 cardioid mics. Only the first minute of video is missing due to me having troubles with the camcorder settings. At first I set it in the &quot;photo&quot; mode and then a beam of light shot from the camcorder and I quickly had to find and disable that option in the menu before the security guys notice me :-)\n\nRight after the intro everybody stood up so I had to stand during the whole concert and handhold the camcorder - so apologies for the occasional shaking but luckily the Panasonic stabilizers are the best! Btw. yes, my arm still hurts. Also there were security guys nearby and I had to walk through metal detectors but I'm not a newbie so I succeeded ;-)\n\nFeel free to spread this video anywhere you want as long as you keep it in original quality without any further edits.\n\nWhite Limo \nAll My Life \nRope \nThe Pretender \nMy Hero \nLearn To Fly \nArlandria \nGenerator \nWalk \nCold Day In The Sun \nNew Way Home \nThese Days \nDOA \nMonkey Wrench \nHey, Johnny Park! \nThis Is A Call \nIn The Flesh?\nBridge Burning \nBest Of You \n----------------\nTimes Like These \nDear Rosemary (with Bob Mould)\nWinnebago\nEverlong","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8a4c44d2ca2c5065ccb15787b92407111179c33","amp;dn":"Foo+Fighters+Prague+15.8.2012+720p+HD+by+Mr.Scully","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8a4c44d2ca2c5065ccb15787b92407111179c33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,164,196,77,44,162,197,6,92,203,21,120,123,146,64,113,17,23,156,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
