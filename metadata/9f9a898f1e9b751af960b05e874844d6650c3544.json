The A&amp;E network reality series, which has performed well enough ratings-wise to get a renewal, is moving on after its 9 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. season-finale episodes.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The show will no longer be in Terrebonne,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Mark Kadin, executive producer. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a definite lesson for me in the politics of Louisiana, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s for sure.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first season so far has averaged about 1.5 million viewers an episode, Kadin said, facing strong competition early and late in its run against the NBA Playoffs and then the Summer Olympics.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A&amp;E is very happy with the numbers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We held our own against the Olympics.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“With such a unique show, we knew it would take a little while to catch on.&quot;\n\nTracking staffers in Sheriff Vernon BourgeoisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ office and the citizens they police, the series met with some negative reaction by viewers in the parish, at least as reflected in the pages and on the website of the Houma Courier, which polled readers and solicited mini-reviews via Facebook.\n\nKadin said he tried to get Larpenter to think about it by increasing the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s payment to the budget-strapped department from $1,500 an episode to $10,000 an episode.\n\nThe answer was still no, Kadin said.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f9a898f1e9b751af960b05e874844d6650c3544","amp;dn":"Cajun+Justice+S01E20E21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f9a898f1e9b751af960b05e874844d6650c3544","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,154,137,143,30,155,117,26,249,96,176,94,135,72,68,214,101,12,53,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
