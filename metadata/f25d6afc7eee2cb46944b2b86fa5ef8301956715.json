Just keeping it alive!!\n\n\nOnce a hotshot investigative reporter, Jack Tagger now bangs out obituaries for a South Florida daily, &quot;plotting to resurrect my career by yoking my byline to some famous stiff.&quot; Jimmy Stoma, the infamous front man of Jimmy and the Slut Puppies, dead in a fishy-smelling scuba &quot;accident&quot; may be just the stiff Jack needs-if only he can figure out what happened. Standing in the way are [among others] an editor who wants Jack to &quot;break her cherry,&quot; Stoma's ambitious pop-singer widow, and the soulless, profit-hungry newspaper owner Jack once publicly humiliated. As clues from Stoma's music give Jack Tagger the chance to trade obits for a story that could hit the front page, murder gives his career a new lease on life.\n\nKeep Seeding!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f25d6afc7eee2cb46944b2b86fa5ef8301956715","amp;dn":"Basket+Case%3B+Carl+Hiaasen+%28Mobi%2C+Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f25d6afc7eee2cb46944b2b86fa5ef8301956715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,93,106,252,126,238,44,180,105,68,178,184,111,165,239,131,1,149,103,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
