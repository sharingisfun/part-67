If FQM can do it, so can I. Not in the description,\nJust in the actual filename. Which inadvertently makes the original capper get \n\ncredit for doing the right thing ... on my AVI version of their work.\n\nSo, now you know - if the description has most of the following text ...\nIt was me being scaredy-cat anonymous. TPB is my home base.\nI have but one mission - to keep AVI alive for those who need or desire it.\n\n\nCC2AVI stands for - &quot;Container Conversion To AVI&quot;.\nThis text is CC2AVI in a nutshell (I'm the nut, this is my shell).\nOr &quot;it's a power we all have, I'm just a little more 'full of it'&quot;.\n\nAnyone can do this - here's how with versions current as of &quot;now&quot;:\n\nShould mention you actually need the MP4 source file first ...\nAnd a Windows PC, I don't know about Mac or Linux yet or maybe never.\n\nYou will need - MP4Cam2AVI 2.98\nYou may need - AtomicParsley win32-0.9.0\nYou don't need - FLV Extract 1.6.2 (not used in this example)\nYou may need - DVBPortal MP4Muxer 0.9.3.0\n\nMP4Cam2AVI is a completely LossLess conversion process.\nIt allows you to &quot;pour&quot; X264 MP4 encodes into an AVI container.\nYou can keep the AAC audio in the conversion process, but ...\nVLC doesn't recognize AAC audio in an AVI container so ...\nI convert the audio to MP3 for universal compatibility.\n\nConversion takes a minute or so, depending on file size.\nFor some MP4 files there's something in the header info that causes:\n&quot;floating point division by zero&quot; error.\n\nLooking high and low I found two solutions, so take your pick:\n\nOne is to rewrite the header, the other is to demux / remux.\n\nThe command line utility syntax to use is:\nAtomicParsley &lt;MP4 filename&gt; -f true\n\nUnless the file is already flagged as a podcast (in which case, choose 'false')\nthis rewrites the MP4 header so that it now thinks it's a podcast. Since the\nCC2AVI process does not carry this info to the AVI - this doesn't matter.\nWhat matters is that the header information is rewritten so you no longer\nget an error.\n\nThere are a couple of items that still may not lend themselves to dissection\nand this makes MP4Muxer the only choice ...\nDemux, remux &amp; MP4Cam2AVI works ...\nFingers crossed.\n\nHave all those MP4 files and an old tablet that can't play them?\nWant to use your favorite AVI editing tools?\nWish you could back up frame by frame in Media Player Classic?\nNow you too can turn any MP4 encode into your favorite AVI.\n\n--------------------\n\nI NEVER claim an x264 encoding credit. I GIVE proper credit where due.\n\nMy offerings are clearly identifiable:\nuse search term &quot;x264.MP3*.avi&quot;\nuse search term &quot;MP4SUX&quot;\nWithout quotes for TPB.\nWith quotes for Google.\n\nMost of my offerings won't have &quot;MP4SUX&quot; in the name unless ...\nI do a re-encode OR I convert from a source web site (FLV mostly).\n\nMP4SUX\n\nNot just an opinion, a state of mind\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:538f6bf85d0b1fac255e08d3392f27f933acc388","amp;dn":"Perception.S01E08.HDTV.x264.MP3-LOL.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"538f6bf85d0b1fac255e08d3392f27f933acc388","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,143,107,248,93,11,31,172,37,94,8,211,57,47,39,249,51,172,195,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
