John Carter is based on a classic novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, whose highly imaginative adventures served as inspiration for many filmmakers, both past and present. The film tells the story of war-weary, former military captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), who is inexplicably transported to Mars where he becomes reluctantly embroiled in a conflict of epic proportions amongst the inhabitants of the planet, including Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and the captivating Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). In a world on the brink of collapse, Carter rediscovers his humanity when he realizes that the survival of Barsoom and its people rests in his hands.\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Fantasy | Sci-Fi\nIMDB rating: 7.0/10 from 5,153 users\nDirected by: Andrew Stanton\nStarring: Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins and Willem Dafoe\n\nRelease Name: John.Carter.2012.CAM.READNFO.XViD-INSPiRAL\nSize: 1.79 GB\nVideo: XviD | 720Ãƒâ€”304 | 2077 Kbps | 25.000fps\nAudio: English | 128 Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 59mn\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee07b3a40cd6320511e0fc87905afc0874aef05e","amp;dn":"John.Carter.2012.CAM.READNFO.XViD-INSPiRAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee07b3a40cd6320511e0fc87905afc0874aef05e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,7,179,164,12,214,50,5,17,224,252,135,144,90,252,8,116,174,240,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
