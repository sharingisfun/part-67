Port Talbot is in a battle for its life. Authoritarian forces have taken over and the town is in thrall to ICU, a sinister and merciless corporation depleting the town of its resources with scant regard for the residents. The atmosphere is explosive. Resistance is inevitable. When a company man and suicide bomber clash on the beach, catastrophe is only averted by the intervention of a softly spoken man who had disappeared 40 days earlier. Revealed later as the Teacher (Michael Sheen), he attracts followers and becomes a focus for the Resistance. His influence quickly draws the attention of ICU, who perceive him as a danger who must be removed at all costs. Taking inspiration from one of the defining narratives of our times, this contemporary re-telling of the Passion story took place across the town, with the people of Port Talbot as its cast, crew and heroes. \n\nGenre: Drama \nIMDB Rating: 6.4/10 \nDirected by: Dave McKean \nStarring: Matthew Aubrey, Nigel Barrett and Jordan Bernarde \n\nRelease Name: The.Gospel.of.Us.2012.DVDRiP.XViD-TASTE \nSize: 700 MB \nVideo: XviD, 640Ãƒâ€”352, 714 kbps \nAudio: English, MP3, 128 kbps \nRuntime: 1h 54m 58s\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79187bab177e6ebd73db2f4d5562b2ace185b2ef","amp;dn":"The+Gospel+of+Us+2012+DVDRiP+XViD-TASTE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79187bab177e6ebd73db2f4d5562b2ace185b2ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,24,123,171,23,126,110,189,115,219,47,77,85,98,178,172,225,133,178,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
