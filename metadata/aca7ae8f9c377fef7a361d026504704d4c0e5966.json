He has bad eyesight, a pure heart, and a secret crush on the store manager, Rokka. Unfortunately for him, Rokka swore off love 8 years ago. But when Ryosuke goes up to her apartment on the second floor, he runs into a good-looking half-naked man. At first upset, he learns that this isn't Rokka's live-in boyfriend; he's the ghost of her late husband, Atsushi. She can't see him, and Ryosuke decides not to give up on her, even with a dead husband standing in the way.\n\nGenres: Drama, Romance, Supernatural, Josei\n\nDuration: 24 min. per episode\n\nRating: PG-13 - Teens 13 or older\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\nSubTitle language : English\n\nRelease date : July 12, 2012\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aca7ae8f9c377fef7a361d026504704d4c0e5966","amp;dn":"%5BCommie%5D+Natsuyuki+Rendezvous+-+02+%5BD2B42ED0%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aca7ae8f9c377fef7a361d026504704d4c0e5966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,167,174,143,156,55,127,239,122,54,29,2,101,4,112,77,76,14,89,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
