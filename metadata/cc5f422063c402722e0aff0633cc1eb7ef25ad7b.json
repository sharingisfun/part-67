The results of the early recordings were released as a series of five 90 minute cassette tapes and eventually as a CD collection called The Basement Tapes in 2003. \n\nThe second home studio has come together almost a quarter century later. Inquisitors of the Crimson Hexagon is made up from an initial set of recordings laid down during April and May 2012. The album is inspired by a short story written by Jorges Luis Borges entitled, The Library of Babel.\n\n\nCorrected Version\nmp3 320kbps\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc5f422063c402722e0aff0633cc1eb7ef25ad7b","amp;dn":"United+States+of+Equanimity%3A+Inquisitors+of+the+Crimson+Hexagon%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc5f422063c402722e0aff0633cc1eb7ef25ad7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,95,66,32,99,196,2,114,46,10,255,6,51,204,30,183,239,37,173,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
