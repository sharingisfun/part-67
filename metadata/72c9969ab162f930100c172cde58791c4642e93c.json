Things quickly take a turn, though, when Peyton finds a baby abandoned on her doorstep, with an anonymous note begging her to take care of the infant. As Peyton begins to do some detective work to find the babyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother, a down-on-her-luck and panicked young woman named Violet (Laci Mailey), she is stunned by the growing maternal instinct she feels for the small child, and must reconcile painful memories of her own child she gave up years ago. Soon, Peyton begins to question whether she will be able to give the child back, or if she can ever even forgive VioletÃ¢â‚¬â€or herself. Can Peyton take her own heart-healing advice and help Violet, or will her own troubled past stop her? \n\nGenre: Drama \nIMDB rating: 5.6/10 \nDirected by: Douglas Barr \nStarring: Genie Francis, Ted McGinley and Laci J Mailey \n\nRelease Name: Notes.From.The.Heart.Healer.2012.DVDRiP.XVID-TASTE \nSize: 700 MB \nVideo: XviD, 640Ãƒâ€”352, 995 kbps \nAudio: English, MP3, 128 Kbps \nRuntime: 1H26M42S\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72c9969ab162f930100c172cde58791c4642e93c","amp;dn":"Notes+From+The+Heart+Healer+2012+DVDRiP+XVID-TASTE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72c9969ab162f930100c172cde58791c4642e93c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,201,150,154,177,98,249,48,16,12,23,44,222,88,121,28,70,66,233,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
