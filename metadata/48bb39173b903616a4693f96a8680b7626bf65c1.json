The centrepiece of The Weight of the Nation is the 4-part documentary series that features case studies and interviews with experts as well as individuals and families struggling with obesity. Each part focuses on a particular issue: &quot;Consequences,&quot; examines the scope of the obesity epidemic and the serious health consequences of being overweight or obese; &quot;Choices,&quot; reveals the science behind obesity and weight loss; &quot;Children in Crisis,&quot; documents the impact the epidemic is having on the nation's children; and &quot;Challenges,&quot; examines the major forces behind the obesity epidemic.\nParts 5 to 16 are a collection of 12 films ranging in length from 11 to 30minutes each part focuses on a particular issue.\n\n\n\n4)  Challenges \nThe myriad of cultural factors involved in the nation's obesity epidemic are explored in this documentary. See the various factors that play into Americans making poor health decisions and the multidimensional approach needed to turn the epidemic around. When it comes to obesity and its related diseases, our zip codes may matter more than our genetic codes. The rates of overweight and obesity are higher in lower-income neighborhoods and some ethnic communities. Being poor is about more than not having money - it also means limited access to affordable healthy foods and safe places where children and adults can play, run, walk, and bicycle.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img441.imageshack.us/img441/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img441.imageshack.us/img441/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img268.imageshack.us/img268/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img268.imageshack.us/img268/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img140.imageshack.us/img140/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img140.imageshack.us/img140/317/weightofthenationseason.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1408 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 224 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 1 - 4 = 67mins\n * RunTime Per Part: 5 - 16 average 11mins - 32mins\n * Number Of Parts: 16\n * Part Size: Parts 1 - 4 = 746 MB\n * Part Size: Parts 5 - 16 = 94 MB - 250 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://theweightofthenation.hbo.com/films&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://theweightofthenation.hbo.com/films&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48bb39173b903616a4693f96a8680b7626bf65c1","amp;dn":"Weight+of+the+Nation+Season+1+04of16+Challenges+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48bb39173b903616a4693f96a8680b7626bf65c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,187,57,23,59,144,54,22,164,105,63,150,168,104,11,118,38,191,101,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
