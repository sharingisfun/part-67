Seyyit Han is a brave loner who is in love with Keje from the next village but before he can have her, he has to deal with his enemies. Keje's brother does not want his sister to be a widow. After seven years and a long jail sentence, when everyone assumes him dead, Seyyit return to claim his bride just as she's about to wed the village headman, Hamdi Bey. Keje is ready to run away with Seyyit but when her brother reminds her that the honour of the family is in her hans, she sends Seyyit away. As the men dand=ce and shoot their rifles into the air to celebrate the wedding, Hamdy Bey makes insidious plans to mend his hurt pride. He buries Keje's body in the ground and cover her head with a basket, challenging Seyyit to a marksmanship contest. Seyyit falls into teh trap and kills the woman he loves.\n\nThe film foregrouns the silence that contaminates women's lives regulated by strict codes of behaviour. The 114 sura of the Koran define the borders of the relationship of women with men and the superior position of men rather than establishing the rights of women. Al-Baqarah, Sura II - ayet 223 informs men that their women are their field to cultivate, meaning the woman is the man's collateral. He can love her or abuse her. The laws of religion and morals are on his side. Keje accepts being buried alive to save the family honour. Like many other Anatolian women, her fate is decided by her brother, her husband or the village head.\n\nFile Name ...............................: Yilmaz GÃƒÂ¼ney-Seyyit Han (1968)\nFile Size (in bytes) .................: 1,049,970,688\nRuntime ..................................: 1:17:58\n\nVideo Codec ..........................: XviD 1.2.2 Final\nFrame Size .............................: 640 x 480 (AR: 1.33)\nFPS .........................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ..........................: 1594 Kb/s\nBits per Pixel ..........................: 0.208 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.....: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nNo. of audio streams .............: 1\nAudio Codec ..........................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...........................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ..........................: 192 Kb/s tot, stereo (2/0), CBR \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193493/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193493/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Turkish\nSubtitles: English, Spanish and Portuguese (srt)\n\nPosted originally at KG by EceAyhan, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ea161ef986295c1deeba490ebe968ac346b3835","amp;dn":"Yilmaz+Guney+-+Seyyit+Han+%281968%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ea161ef986295c1deeba490ebe968ac346b3835","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,161,97,239,152,98,149,193,222,235,164,144,235,233,104,172,52,107,56,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
