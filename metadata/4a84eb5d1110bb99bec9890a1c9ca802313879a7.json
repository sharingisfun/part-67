Given his grueling job, his alcoholic father, and the attention of the sinister Lars Hoeglin (Knut Husebe), Billy wants to get to Philadelphia as soon as possible. He comes to the attention of John Reese (Donald Sutherland) and his young housekeeper Alice Spangler (Mia Sara). \n\nReese teaches Billy how to read and employs him as his assistant in his powwow work. Despite some initial successes, it becomes clear that HoeglinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shadow lies across Reese, leading to a climactic showdown of good versus evil Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or, perhaps, simply the depraved actions of two madmen.\n\nFor those who know the story of the Nelson Rehmeyer murder, this will sound quite familiar, and the movie is supposedly based on the famous case. You can learn about the murder here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehmeyer%27s_Hollow#The_Murder_of_Nelson_Rehmeyer\nThe movieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strong points are SutherlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance as the powwower and the more-or-less accurate portrayal of actual powwowing ceremonies. (No one, however, has ever heard about demonic forces tossing a powwower across the room.) Reese is the only fully-fleshed character in the piece, and what makes the movie work is that his story is not straightforward. He spent time in &quot;the funny farm&quot; (quoting the movie), and we can never be sure when we can believe him or whether he believes himself. Husebe also deserves credit for creating a role which is either that of a crotchety old man or a demonic monster, but whose true nature is never explained.\n\nBy the way, docto","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a84eb5d1110bb99bec9890a1c9ca802313879a7","amp;dn":"Apprentice+to+Murder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a84eb5d1110bb99bec9890a1c9ca802313879a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,132,235,93,17,16,187,153,190,201,137,10,28,156,168,2,49,56,121,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
