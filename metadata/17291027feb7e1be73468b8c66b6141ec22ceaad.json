You probably need to copy the dll file to your windows folder.\n\nI checked it with AVG and there are no viruses.\n\nHere the link to the &quot;autor&quot;. In my torrent the missing DLL is already included.\n\n\nRegards\nAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17291027feb7e1be73468b8c66b6141ec22ceaad","amp;dn":"Element+3D+license+generator%2C+is+this+the+real+thing%3F+%28%3F%3F%3F%3F%3Fwork","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17291027feb7e1be73468b8c66b6141ec22ceaad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,41,16,39,254,183,225,190,115,70,139,140,102,182,20,30,194,44,234,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
