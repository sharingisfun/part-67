But in his bold, grassroots, seat-of-the-pants campaign, he energized young and progressive Americans to a degree never before seen, and began the genesis of today's powerful and sophisticated progressive movement. ONE BRIGHT SHINING MOMENT retraces George McGovern's campaign of 1972 and offers a portrait of one of the most honest men in political history. \n\nONE BRIGHT SHINING MOMENT tells the tale of a campaign that may have been the ultimate American political defeat, but also perhaps its highest watermark. A campaign built on a platform of peace and justice, ideas and people first and on an understanding of America's role in the human race. It also questions the electoral process, the American government, and revitalizes a belief in the power of honest values in politics while re-introducing this inspiring man who continues to work today to bring these values into American life.\n\nNarrated by Amy Goodman, host of Pacifica Network's Democracy Now and author of the current bestseller 'The Exception To The Rulers', ONE BRIGHT SHINING MOMENT uses a wealth of archival materials, interviews with prominent progressives like Howard Zinn, Gore Vidal, Gloria Steinem, Warren Beatty, Ron Kovic and Dick Gregory and features music from Bob Dylan, Robbie Robertson, Donovan, Leon Russell and Elvis Costello. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://firstrunfeatures.com/onebrightdvd.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://firstrunfeatures.com/onebrightdvd.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468528/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468528/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/onebright.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/onebright.php&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2005/09/16/one_bright_shining_moment/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2005/09/16/one_bright_shining_moment/index.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/one-bright-shining-moment-the-forgotten-summer-of-george-mcgovern-20051&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/one-bright-shining-moment-the-forgotten-summer-of-george-mcgovern-20051&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fulvuedrive-in.com/review/3675/]Fulvue&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fulvuedrive-in.com/review/3675/]Fulvue&lt;/a&gt; Drive-In\n\n\nFormat : AVI\nFile size : 1.42 GiB\nDuration : 2h 4mn\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\nOverall bit rate : 1 632 Kbps\nVideo #0\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nCodec ID : XVID\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.85:1\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.181\nAudio #1\nCodec ID : MP3\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 117 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nWriting library : LAME3.99r\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef124c0c5d8807657f1b9b13828c3f4c5f8137e5","amp;dn":"ONE+BRIGHT+SHINING+MOMENT+TheForgottenSummerOfGeorgeMcGovern2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef124c0c5d8807657f1b9b13828c3f4c5f8137e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,18,76,12,93,136,7,101,127,27,155,19,130,140,63,76,95,129,55,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
