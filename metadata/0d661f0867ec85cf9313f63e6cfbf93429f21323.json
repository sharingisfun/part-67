Liberate yourself by learning what elite private schools teach wealthy students.  \n\nWhen John Taylor Gatto resigned from his job after becoming New York School Teacher of the Year, he did so on the Op-Ed page of the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Ultimate History Lesson is a five-hour interview with Gatto, memorializing his research, publications and life experiences.  It forms an impeccable resource and reference library on The Underground History of American Education.\n\nEach hour examines the evolution of the malicious ideas which manifest today in the mind-crippling phenomenon of &quot;public schooling&quot;.
