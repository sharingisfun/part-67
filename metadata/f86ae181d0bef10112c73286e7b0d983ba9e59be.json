This process involves much more than just technical knowledge, and this book provides all the information you'll need to understand the concepts behind designing and developing for the Web, as well as the best means to deliver professional results based on best practices.\n\nOf course, there is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. We also make sure you're up to date by using the latest HTML5 features. Planning is vital, so you'll also learn to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops.\n\nAn understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential for any web professional; this book explains how HTML5 should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You'll learn about the wide range of HTML5 elements available to you, and you'll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages.\n\nWithout creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS enables you to set your website apart from the rest, while maintaining the integrity of your markup. We'll showcase the new features of CSS3 and how you can use them. You'll learn how CSS3 works and how to apply styles to your pages, allowing you to realize your design ideas in the browser.\n\nJavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of JavaScript programming. You'll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax, and in turn, where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture.\n\nWhile a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and this book explains how best to accomplish these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life cycle. \n\n\n# Paperback: 296 pages\n# Publisher: friendsofED; 1 edition (July 18, 2012)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1430237899\n# ISBN-13: 978-1430237891","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f86ae181d0bef10112c73286e7b0d983ba9e59be","amp;dn":"Foundation+Website+Creation+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f86ae181d0bef10112c73286e7b0d983ba9e59be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,106,225,129,208,190,241,1,18,199,50,134,231,176,217,131,186,158,89,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
