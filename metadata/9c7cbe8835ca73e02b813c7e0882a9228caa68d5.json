That changed when in 1989, the George H.W. Bush administration declared drug-trafficking a &quot;threat to national security&quot; and authorized the deployment of thousands of troops to the US-Mexico border. In 1997, during the Clinton administration, Esequiel Hernandez became the first American killed by U.S. military forces on native soil since the 1970 Kent State shootings. \n\nNarrated by Tommy Lee Jones (a native of west Texas whose film The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada was inspired by the HernÃƒÂ¡ndez shooting), The Ballad of Esequiel Hernandez features a full array of remarkably candid accounts from three of the four Marines on the fatal mission; Esequiel's family, friends and teachers; Marine Corps investigators; FBI and defense attorneys. The film also makes use of military investigative video and audio recordings of radio communication between the Marine team and their commanders before HernÃƒÂ¡ndez was shot. \n\nBoth the Department of Defense and the Justice Departmant blatantly lied about the incident, covering up the truth that a Marine murdered a good Texan.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/pov/ballad/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/pov/ballad/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1014761/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1014761/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.der.org/films/ballad-of-esequiel-hernandez.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.der.org/films/ballad-of-esequiel-hernandez.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esequiel_Hern%C3%A1ndez_Jr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esequiel_Hern%C3%A1ndez_Jr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/pov-the-ballad-of-esequiel-hernandez/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/pov-the-ballad-of-esequiel-hernandez/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2008-06-06/632179/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2008-06-06/632179/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDVDrip with AutoGK\nRip specs:\n      Format : AVI\n      Duration : 1h 22mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 380 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Advanced Simple@L5\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Bit rate : 2 148 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 400 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.255\n   Audio #1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 224 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Bit depth : 16 bits\n      Language : English/Spanish\n\nTried ripping subtitles with SubRip to srt but ran into lots of trouble.
