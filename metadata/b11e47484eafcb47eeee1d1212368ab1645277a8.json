But were they really guilty and did they get a fair trial?\n\nThe 2011 Minsk Metro bombing occurred on 11 April 2011 when at least 15 people were killed and more than two hundred were injured in an explosion on the Minsk Metro, Belarus. The explosion happened at the central Oktyabrskaya station at 17:55 local time at the peak of rush hour.\n\nThe trials attracted international political condemnation and the verdicts passed out have been questioned, primarily by the Belarusian opposition and the EU. The bombing came at a time of economic problems and protests against Lukashenko's government. Some believe that the Belarusian secret police planted the device, rigged a show trial and tortured confessions out of the two suspects. \n\nIn March, 2012 both men (Kanavalau and Kavalyou) were executed by shooting.\n\nFile Name ..........: Our.World.Bombing.Belarus-tbz.avi\n\nSource: http://thebox.bz/details.php?id=205319\nCap:\tottopilot\n\nshunster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b11e47484eafcb47eeee1d1212368ab1645277a8","amp;dn":"Our+World+-+Bombing+Belarus++2012+08+18++BBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b11e47484eafcb47eeee1d1212368ab1645277a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,30,71,72,78,175,203,71,238,238,29,18,18,54,138,177,100,82,119,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
