A definitive member of the Thule Musik collective, Yagya also is known for his work as half of Sanasol and also the famed Plastic.\n\nA student of computer science at the University of Iceland Yagya spends his free time creating music on his computer. He concentrates on atmospheres and moods and tries to reflect the beauty of the world around him in the sounds of his music.
