This remarkable film documents one young male leopard's fight for survival and his place in the community hierarchy. One hundred and fifty pounds of strength, the four-year old male leopard,Tjololo, stalks his meals with liquid smooth movements. But keeping his catch from the animals that share his domain will require tough lessons and numerous heated confrontations. Hyenas approach as he rushes to free a freshly killed carcass, and Tjololo soon learns that success can be a matter of inches. STALKING LEOPARDS is an intimate chronicle of Tjololos journey into adulthood: claiming territory, fighting old rivals, mating and killing. For Tjololo, amidst Africa's wild cast of lions, water buffalo, hyenas, elephants, and impalas - the only way to walk is proudly and alone.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1925 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 624x472\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.322:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 53:37.080\nNumber Of Parts: 14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c7c3e1edb30334604138a85d25ce2f3b66526c7","amp;dn":"NG.Wildlife.Wonders.06of14.Stalking.Leopards.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c7c3e1edb30334604138a85d25ce2f3b66526c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,124,62,30,219,48,51,70,4,19,138,133,210,92,226,243,182,101,38,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
