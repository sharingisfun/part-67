Civil war erupts when newly elected Mexican president, Plutarco Elias Calles (RubÃƒÂ©n Blades), begins a violent and relentless crackdown against the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Catholic faithful. The film depicts the carnage by showing churches being set on fire, nuns subjected to extreme harassment, Catholic priests murdered and countless faithful peasants killed and then publicly hanged on telegraph poles. The story shifts to Father Christopher (Peter OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Toole), a Catholic priest, who is ruthlessly murdered by the Federales (government forces). The killing is witnessed by a thirteen-year-old boy named JosÃƒÂ© Luis Sanchez (Mauricio Kuri). Driven by anger and rage, JosÃƒÂ© joins the rebels, or Cristeros (Ã¢â‚¬Å“soldiers for ChristÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), fighting against Calles. Their battle cry is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã‚Â¡Viva Cristo Rey!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (meaning Ã¢â‚¬Å“Long live Christ the KingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). The rebel leader, retired general Enrique Gorostieta (Andy Garcia), an agnostic, takes an interest in young JosÃƒÂ© and the boy soon becomes his protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©. Later while fighting against the Federales, JosÃƒÂ© is captured in a firefight and is tortured to force him to renounce his belief in God. When he resolutely defends his faith, he is executed. The next year Gorostieta is killed in a battle at Jalisco. \n\nGenre: Drama | History | War \nIMDB Rating: 6.5/10 from 1,148 users \nDirected by: Dean Wright \nStarring: Andy Garcia, Oscar Isaac and Catalina Sandino Moreno \n\nRelease Name: For.Greater.Glory.The.True.Story.Of.Cristiada.2012.DVDRip.XviD-GECKOS \nSize: 2 CD \nVideo: XviD, 640Ãƒâ€”272, 880 Kbps \nAudio: English, AC3, 448Kbps \nRuntime: 145 min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:812d16411fe1085c8c10adfcb2f328bc22f716a2","amp;dn":"For.Greater.Glory.The.True.Story.Of.Cristiada.2012.DVDRip.XviD-G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"812d16411fe1085c8c10adfcb2f328bc22f716a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,45,22,65,31,225,8,92,140,16,173,252,178,243,40,188,34,247,22,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
