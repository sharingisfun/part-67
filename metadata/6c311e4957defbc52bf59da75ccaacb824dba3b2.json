Its no biggie mainly it\nappears from 55th min to 67th min, and a few times after that Playback may come\nto you choppy, so thats whyy we mentioned it and nobody can whine about not\nmentioning it\n\nAUDIO:\n\nSync was a biatch to do due to the problems mentioned above. Audio had to be\nstretched and restretched many times and also we had to do a lot of cuts. You\nwont notice them cuts because we tried to cut only &quot;dead parts&quot; - where there was\nno speaking. There was a lot of effort put into our sync and others who tried to\nattempt the sync will knowwhat we are talking about \nOnce synced, we had to clean audio from all the weird noice, hum, hiss, crackle\netc...If trying to remove all of them comletely, we would ruin the eq band and\nmake audio sound muffled and &quot;robotic noise&quot; in background. So, decided to go for\nsofter settings and use more filters to come to an end we &quot;loved&quot; the most\n\nIMDB Info:\n\nName: Total Recall\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi\nIMDB Link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386703/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386703/&lt;/a&gt;  \nIMDB Rating: 6.3/10 from 13,411 users\nDirector: Len Wiseman\nWriters: Kurt Wimmer, Mark Bomback\nCast: Colin Farrell, Bokeem Woodbine and Bryan Cranston\nPlot: A factory worker, Douglas Quaid, begins to suspect that he is a spy after\nvisiting Rekall - a company that provides its clients with implanted fake\nmemories of a life they would like to have led - goes wrong and he finds himself\non the run. \n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/18135782056523828520.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/18135782056523828520.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/47879162804566667530.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/47879162804566667530.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/27005528263128891340.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/27005528263128891340.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/63576818507000958408.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/63576818507000958408.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21191974536633637571.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21191974536633637571.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/80490135080434549868.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/80490135080434549868.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c311e4957defbc52bf59da75ccaacb824dba3b2","amp;dn":"Total.Recall.2012.TS.NEW.SOURCE.READNFO.XViD-INSPiRAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c311e4957defbc52bf59da75ccaacb824dba3b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,49,30,73,87,222,251,197,43,245,157,167,92,202,172,184,36,219,163,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
