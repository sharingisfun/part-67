A-10C has been upgraded to meet 21 st century standards, using systems such as Multi-Function Color Displays (MFCD), GPS-guided weapons, and data-link support. Retaining all the features of older A-10A, the A-10C has turned into a true precision strike fighter with the most modern navigation systems, precision attack weapons (Maverick, JDAM, WCMD, and laser-guided bombs), and an integrated countermeasures system.\nThe A-10C has participated in operations over Iraq and Afghanistan and proved to be a precise and effective weapon in the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;. Its advanced equipment has greatly reduced the number of &quot;friendly fire&quot; incidents - thanks largely to the Situational Awareness Datalink (SADL) and the ability to better identify targets with using the Litening II AT targeting pod.\n\nThe A-10C of course retains its ability to do what it was originally designed to do: kill tanks in a conventional force-on-force battlefield.\nDespite the fact that many of the computer and weapon systems are new in the A-10C, most of the remaining systems are retained from the A-10A. Engines, fuel, electrical, hydraulic and emergency systems, communications, and lighting do not differ from those in the latest versions of A-10A/A-10A+. As with previous versions, the A-10C - very easy to fly and is a stable and survivable weapons platform. For those familiar with DCS: Black Shark, we feel that the A-10C will be much easier to fly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f6d22dccee065140376c5a53d106fee8df5018b","amp;dn":"DCS+A-10c+FULL%2BAll+Patches%2B+v1.1.1.1+Unlocker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f6d22dccee065140376c5a53d106fee8df5018b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,109,34,220,206,224,101,20,3,118,197,165,61,16,111,238,141,245,1,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
