This allows GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Word to speak to people in more than 200 countries in languages they know and understand. By GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grace, it is yielding a spiritual harvest of unprecedented results.\n\nNot only is the story of the &quot;JESUS&quot; film one of effective evangelism, but also a powerful tool for expanding the church worldwide. Hundreds of churches, missions groups and denominational agencies, both indigenous and global, are also seeing this tool ignite the launch and growth of thousands of new churches.\n\nOne denominational leader, whose ministry has used the &quot;JESUS&quot; film for more than a decade, has said that its value in accelerating their church-planting efforts is equivalent to &quot;fishing with dynamite!&quot; His ministry alone has birthed more than 26,000 church fellowships using the &quot;JESUS&quot; film in dozens of languages.\n\nGod is using this film in powerful ways to reach people and build His church worldwide. And yet, so much of the world remains in spiritual darkness. Billions of people have never had the opportunity to hear GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s message of salvation and say &quot;yes&quot; to Christ.\n\nThe JESUS Film Project is reaching millions with the gospel of Christ, but with your help, so many more can be reached. By getting involved today, you can make a difference in the lives of people through the message of hopeÃ¢â‚¬â€Jesus, and bring God's light into the darkness.\n\nRead Life-Changing Stories from the Mission Field...\nA Cry of Desperation\n\n   by Staff Writer, The JESUS Film Project\n   Aug 1, 2012 6:00 am\n   Asia\n\nIn South Asia, two church-planting team members began work among a people group. As they showed &quot;JESUS&quot; to the local community, they watched the crowd grow excited about the miracles Jesus performed.
