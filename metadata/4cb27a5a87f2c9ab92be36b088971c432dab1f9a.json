The CD includes performances by several either underrated (Edgar Blanchard, Jerry Morris) or obscure (Eddie Lang, Mercy Baby) acts. They're mostly period pieces from the late '50s and early '60s that range from stomping instrumental workouts to wailing testimonials, heartache numbers, novelty tunes, and songs reflecting the influence of Little Richard or Larry Williams. Eddie Lang gets the most space (five tunes) and displays a good sound and energized tone. Blanchard and the Gondoliers, and Morris with Clarence Garlow's Orchestra provide driving musical punch. There's nothing fantastic or earth-shaking here, but much that's entertaining and instructive.~Ron Wynn (Allmusic)\n\n01. Eddie Lang - Troubles Troubles\n02. Eddie Lang - She's Mine All Mine\n03.
