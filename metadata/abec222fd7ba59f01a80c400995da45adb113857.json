The centrepiece of The Weight of the Nation is the 4-part documentary series that features case studies and interviews with experts as well as individuals and families struggling with obesity. Each part focuses on a particular issue: &quot;Consequences,&quot; examines the scope of the obesity epidemic and the serious health consequences of being overweight or obese; &quot;Choices,&quot; reveals the science behind obesity and weight loss; &quot;Children in Crisis,&quot; documents the impact the epidemic is having on the nation's children; and &quot;Challenges,&quot; examines the major forces behind the obesity epidemic.\nParts 5 to 16 are a collection of 12 films ranging in length from 11 to 30minutes each part focuses on a particular issue.\n\n\n\n\n10)  Poverty and Obesity \nIt's shocking to believe that, in a country as developed as ours, something as innocuous as the neighborhood you live in could so strongly affect your lifespan. When it comes to obesity and its related chronic diseases, some evidence suggests that your zip code may matter more than your genetic code. This bonus short offers a sweeping view of the issues surrounding socioeconomic disparities that can dramatically affect not just health, but life expectancy. We touch down in cities across the country and hear from local residents and preeminent thinkers on the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1408 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 224 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 1 - 4 = 67mins\n * RunTime Per Part: 5 - 16 average 11mins - 32mins\n * Number Of Parts: 16\n * Part Size: Parts 1 - 4 = 746 MB\n * Part Size: Parts 5 - 16 = 94 MB - 250 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://theweightofthenation.hbo.com/films&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://theweightofthenation.hbo.com/films&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abec222fd7ba59f01a80c400995da45adb113857","amp;dn":"Weight+of+the+Nation+Season+1+10of16+Poverty+and+Obesity+XviD+AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abec222fd7ba59f01a80c400995da45adb113857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,236,34,47,215,186,89,240,26,128,196,0,153,93,164,90,219,17,56,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
