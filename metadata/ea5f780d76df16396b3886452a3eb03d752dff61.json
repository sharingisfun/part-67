Introduction\n2. Polar Bears\n3. Churchill\n4. Sun Bear\n5. The Spectacle Bear\n6. The Brown Bear\nRunning Time: Approx 50 minutes\n\nLords of the Wild: Fighting For Survival is a superb one hour special, featuring every species of bear around the world,and their fight for survival. \n\nHighlights include two towering polar bears engaging in a contest of intense energy, a giant grizzly tussling with her spring cub and brown bears feasting on spawning salmon. \n\nThese are images that may seemingly show that bears, as a species, are thriving. But the truth is somewhat less attractive. The bare facts about the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bear population are frightening. \n\nThis programme will show that only the polar bear is surviving in sufficient numbers in the wild to make it relatively safe. Some of their darker cousins are staring extinction in the face.\n\nScreen Shot: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimage.org/gallery/7auv4e0g/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimage.org/gallery/7auv4e0g/&lt;/a&gt; \n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ezydvd.com.au/DVD/graingers-world-lords-of-the-wild-fighting-for-survival/dp/786847&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ezydvd.com.au/DVD/graingers-world-lords-of-the-wild-fighting-for-survival/dp/786847&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea5f780d76df16396b3886452a3eb03d752dff61","amp;dn":"Greg++Grainger+Lords+Of+The+Wild+-+fighting+for+survival","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea5f780d76df16396b3886452a3eb03d752dff61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,95,120,13,118,223,22,57,107,56,134,69,42,62,176,61,117,45,255,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
