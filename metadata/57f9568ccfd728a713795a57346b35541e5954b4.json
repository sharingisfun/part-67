Total WYSIWYG control of everything including background image and window location. Use any image for your container icon, not just .ICNS files. Even change the icon of files already added to a project. No artwork? No problem. Choose a theme from our gallery of backdrops and icons.\n\nBuild: Revise your project as often as you need and at any stage. Add and update text without editing your background images. Typos are painless to fix. Accessing your MacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful security features is easier than ever - add encryption for extra protection. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget the End User License Agreement. Putting legal notices where they belong is simple.\n\nRelease: Burn your project directly to CD or DVD, no need for other apps. Release your project as a tamper-proof disk image.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New in this Version\n- Now Snow Leopard compatible\n- License file loading issue fixed.\n- Numerous bug fixes and overall interface improvement\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57f9568ccfd728a713795a57346b35541e5954b4","amp;dn":"DMG.Architect.v1.6.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57f9568ccfd728a713795a57346b35541e5954b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,249,86,140,207,215,40,167,19,121,90,87,52,107,53,84,30,89,84,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
