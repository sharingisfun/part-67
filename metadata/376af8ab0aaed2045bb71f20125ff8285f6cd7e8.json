Though this classical curiosity secured a Top 30 placing, there was a nagging sense that they had yet to fulfil their true potential.\n\nRecorded in snatches between relentless gigging over a six month period, In Rock, released in June 1970, did just that. In some respects the material was a skilful synthesis of what was already in the air. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Into The FireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ simmers some of the juice left over from Hendrix (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Purple HazeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and Cream (Ã¢â‚¬Å“PoliticianÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (not originally on the album but included on the anniversary edition) is a steroid-enhanced augmentation of the Blue MagoosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“(We AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Got) NothinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Yet.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Even the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rhapsodic stand-out centrepiece, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Child In TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was itself adapted from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bombay CallingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by US psychedelic folk rockers, &quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A Beautiful Day&quot;. In lesser hands a sculpting of such unlikely raw materials might not have worked.\n\nThat it did is evidence of their strident confidence that the new line-up had found. Deep Purple raised the bar thanks to the water-tight rhythm section of Glover and drummer Ian Paice, who together underpinned the diamond-hard riffing from which Ritchie BlackmoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fast-moving excursions would go head to head with Jon LordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s neo-classical noodlings, like a couple of cranked-up kamikaze. That we take the seam-splitting cod-operatics as the norm for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heavy metal tonsil-torturers is due in no small measure to lead singer Ian GillanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work here. Not even Led ZeppelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Robert Plant had the range of shrill theatrics or glass-worrying octaves achieved by Gillan on this record.\n\nTheir collective chutzpah was captured via the album sleeve; rarely has a cover so presciently reflected the monumental influence its contents would have in the years that followed. Reaching number 2 in the UK charts in 1970, it made the band and pretty much carved out the template for heavy rock.\n\n\n-----------\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Deep Purple - Intro [0:53]\n2.
