In the event you do not have 7-zip, I included the setup for it.  I also included the setup for Virtual Clone Drive so you can mount your ISO, and an ISO burner. The PDF contains part of a blog from a member.  He/she provides a list of instructions for installing Matlab.  The final file is an MSWord doc that contains the File Installation Key (FIK) provided by this member.\n\nRichard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c745f3346dce7a53b192ca6eabb7beed91e018b","amp;dn":"Matlab+r2009b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c745f3346dce7a53b192ca6eabb7beed91e018b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,116,95,51,70,220,231,165,59,25,44,166,234,187,123,238,217,30,1,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
