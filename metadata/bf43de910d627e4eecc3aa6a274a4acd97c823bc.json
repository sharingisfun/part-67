At the beginning it was much different than it is now. I was often shooting alone and uploading my photos only to one website called Fotocommunity.de. Last year I started to organize photo-walks in cities I was traveling to but my method of photography changed when I met Eric Kim who taught a Street Photography workshop in Beirut, Lebanon in November 2010. I sponsored 2/3 of Eric's trip with the condition that I could join him. This gesture really changed a lot for me.\nFirst of all I was able to teach Street Photography for the first time to a highly motivated audience in a place I had never been before. It turned out to be the trip of a lifetime and for the people there it was life changing as well. They founded the Beirut Street Photographers (BSP) group which is growing massively. They organize street tours within Lebanon on a monthly basis and give TV and radio interviews. I was with them on a trip in Istanbul in July and it was great to see them all again.&quot;.....Author","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf43de910d627e4eecc3aa6a274a4acd97c823bc","amp;dn":"Collecting+Souls+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf43de910d627e4eecc3aa6a274a4acd97c823bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,67,222,145,13,98,126,78,236,195,170,106,39,74,74,205,151,200,35,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
