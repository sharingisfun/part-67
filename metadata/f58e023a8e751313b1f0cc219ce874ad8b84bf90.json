Upon returning to college, Aaron and a few friends began a weekly late-night worship service, called Underground, which convened for two years and attracted hundreds of college students from across the state. Since then, Aaron has served as the worship pastor for CrossRoads Community Church, worship leader for Wayfarer Ministries' 20-something Bible-study called Engage, and he has traveled around the nation and to various countries to worship with various other communities as well. His passion is for the body of Christ to come together in Biblical praise. \n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - August 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f58e023a8e751313b1f0cc219ce874ad8b84bf90","amp;dn":"Aaron+Keyes+Discography+2004-2011+%283+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f58e023a8e751313b1f0cc219ce874ad8b84bf90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,142,2,58,142,117,19,19,177,240,204,33,156,232,116,173,139,132,191,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
