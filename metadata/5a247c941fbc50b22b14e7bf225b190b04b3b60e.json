The effort is part of a special 25th anniversary edition of the King of Pop's seventh studio album. Titled Bad 25, the forthcoming LP debuts Sept. 18.\n\nThe new &quot;Bad&quot; remix features much more modern rhythms, a speedier beat and a heavier bass line in place of '80s-era synthesizers -- all the handiwork of Afrojack and DJ Buddha. Pitbull also raps brand new verses, calling his version of the song &quot;a toast to the king for life.&quot; The track is truly a modern take on Jackson's classic song.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete name:Bad (Afrojack Remix)\n\nAudioFormat:MP3\n\nArtist: Michael Jackson ft Pitbull\n\nYear : 2012 August\n\nGenre:POP\n\nFile Size: 2.32 MB\n\nOverallbit rate: 320 kbps\n\nWriting Libray: LAME3.98.3\n\nChannel(s): 2 Channels\n\nSampling rate: 48.2 Kz\n\nCover : Yes ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a247c941fbc50b22b14e7bf225b190b04b3b60e","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+ft+Pitbull+-+Bad+%28Afrojack+Remix%29+Snippet+.mp3+%E2%98%86","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a247c941fbc50b22b14e7bf225b190b04b3b60e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,36,124,148,31,188,80,178,43,20,231,191,34,91,25,11,4,179,182,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
