When Henry divorced her mother and married Anne Boleyn, Mary became an outcast and a threat to the Protestant succession. By a twist of fate, on the death of her brother, she became queen at last in 1553, but her attempts to make England Catholic again were a disaster for her and the country. History has called her &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; for the burning of the Protestants, but how fair is this? This film paints another picture, of a woman true to her beliefs, pushed towards a terrible psychological disintegration.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1255905/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1255905/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c06eff4bbb45f9f2a8660eca039a4af8557dbc0","amp;dn":"The+Twisted+Tale+of+Bloody+Mary+++%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c06eff4bbb45f9f2a8660eca039a4af8557dbc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,6,239,244,187,180,95,159,42,134,96,236,160,57,164,175,133,87,219,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
