But they're the same generals we know in name only: their appearance, personality, and gender are all different. One day, first Oda Nobunaga and then all the others are transported to our world. Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dd5a5d68efa0169fc4d2ac5e563882b231cf223","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+23+%5B480p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dd5a5d68efa0169fc4d2ac5e563882b231cf223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,213,165,214,142,250,1,105,252,77,42,197,229,99,136,43,35,28,242,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
