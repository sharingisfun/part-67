It is available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh. The current version is 4.1.1.\n\nUrban Terror can be described as a Hollywood tactical shooter; somewhat realism based, but the motto is &quot;fun over realism&quot;. This results in a very unique, enjoyable and addictive game.\n\nNo registration required: Download, install, play!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3715e9e8670caefbd80412f1edc9a2b8b16f8657","amp;dn":"UrbanTerror+4.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3715e9e8670caefbd80412f1edc9a2b8b16f8657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,21,233,232,103,12,174,251,216,4,18,241,237,201,162,184,177,111,134,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
