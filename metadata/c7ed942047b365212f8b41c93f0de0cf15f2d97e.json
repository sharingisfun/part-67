Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7ed942047b365212f8b41c93f0de0cf15f2d97e","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+17+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7ed942047b365212f8b41c93f0de0cf15f2d97e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,237,148,32,71,179,101,33,47,139,65,201,63,13,224,207,21,242,217,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
