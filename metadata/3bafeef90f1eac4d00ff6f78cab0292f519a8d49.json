Hitler was inspired by evolutionary theory to pursue the utopian project of biologically improving the human race, and this ethic underlay or influenced almost every major feature of Nazi policy: eugenics, euthanasia, racism, population expansion, offensive warfare, and racial extermination. This groundbreaking study provides truly fresh insights into one of the darkest chapters of the twentieth century as well as the field of evolutionary studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bafeef90f1eac4d00ff6f78cab0292f519a8d49","amp;dn":"Hitler%27s+Ethic+The+Nazi+Pursuit+of+Evolutionary+Progress.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bafeef90f1eac4d00ff6f78cab0292f519a8d49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,175,238,249,15,30,172,77,0,255,111,120,202,176,41,47,81,154,141,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
