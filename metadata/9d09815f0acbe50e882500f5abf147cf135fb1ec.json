If you're taking the time to bother to read this you're already probably (like me) a complete Creepshow obsessive.\n\nIm going to focus on the DVD itself:\n\nPICTURE\nFirstly the film is presented in widescreen. The American import DVD included a widescreen version of the film on one side and an &quot;unmatted&quot; version on the other that had more vertical picture information. The widescreen version is the correct ratio and was how the film was seen in theatres. The picture is greatly improved on the previous edition. Much sharper and clearer though their are marks and scratches on the negative itself which are not too distracting and acceptable for a film of its age.\n\nSOUND\nThere is a 5.1 sound option which I can't comment on as I don't have the right equipment. The stereo track is clear giving clear dialogue and vivid music. (UPDATE: I've since bought a surround system and can report that the film sounds GREAT in 5.1. Especially the famous soundtrack!)\n\nEXTRAS\nThis is what really makes the release. There is a feature length (90 mins approx) documentary, which is good but would benefit from more of the stars being in it (Ted Danson, Leslie Nielson) and Stephen King's absence is keenly felt. The deleted scenes are taken from the workprint of the film and do not include (as rumoured) the sequence with Ted Danson's hand coming off or Adrienne Barbeau's characters head coming out of the crate. The commentary is decent but suffers from the moderator being too jokey and he actually interrupts Romero and FX man Tom Savini at times.\n\nOVERALL\nAn excellent DVD release which, though it feels ungrateful and petty to say so, could probably have been a little better. Still a great effort though and the best release we're likely to see of what is pretty much an obscure film.
