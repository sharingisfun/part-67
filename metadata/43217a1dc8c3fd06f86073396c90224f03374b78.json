It is available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh. The current version is 4.1.1.\n\nUrban Terror can be described as a Hollywood tactical shooter; somewhat realism based, but the motto is &quot;fun over realism&quot;. This results in a very unique, enjoyable and addictive game.\n\nNo registration required: Download, install, play!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.urbanterror.info/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.urbanterror.info/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43217a1dc8c3fd06f86073396c90224f03374b78","amp;dn":"Urban+Terror+4.1.1+Windows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43217a1dc8c3fd06f86073396c90224f03374b78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,33,122,29,200,195,253,6,248,96,115,57,108,144,34,79,3,55,75,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
