IDRMyImage is the\nsolution to this problem.\n\nTake several shots with different exposure times and fuse them\ntogether using IDRMyImage.\n\nIt is easy and fast with natural looking results and a dynamic\nrange of tones. No artificial colors or structures are seen. In\nthe application you can easily adjust several parameters of the\nfusion to get the best result.\n\nFrom the technique it is obvious that the algorithm works best\non nearly static scenes. Moreover we strongly recommend using a\ntripod while capturing source photos.\n\n+ I N S T A L L +\n\n1) Unpack and install.\n2) Apply license.txt\n3) Enjoy this release!\n\nNOTE: For obvious reasons you should always make sure that\nthe title is restricted access to internet by a firewall\nto avoid any problems. Further, when running our\nkeygens/patches you might need to run it with admin\nrights while in Vista/Win7 to ensure that it has\nenough privileges.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd1548758700ce98154464edf3bbdc6e98d07577","amp;dn":"IDRMyImage+v2.01-Lz0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd1548758700ce98154464edf3bbdc6e98d07577","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,21,72,117,135,0,206,152,21,68,100,237,243,187,220,110,152,208,117,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
