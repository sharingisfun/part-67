Are you in love (platonically, of course) with penguins? Well, zip up that parka and get ready: Arctic Escape, a Lemmings-inspired strategy/puzzle game, is here!\n\nA mad scientist has abducted a colony of Antarctic penguins and spirited them away to the North Pole. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your job to help the penguins escape by navigating them through 100+ fun-and-frosty levels, using commands like &quot;walk&quot;, &quot;jump&quot;, &quot;turn&quot; and &quot;wait&quot;. Along the way, your problem-solving abilities will be put to the test by broken ice, falling cages, hungry wolves and other dangerous obstacles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not to mention the fact that the further you progress, the more cute and naÃƒÂ¯ve penguins youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be responsible for.\n\nFeatures:\nEASY TO LEARN GAMEPLAY AND CONTROLS\nA simple and intuitive interface requiring only one finger to issue drag-and-drop commands on a map and lead your penguins to safety.\n\n100+ CHALLENGING LEVELS\nTravel through eight icy worlds, each with 13 levels of varying design and complexity. The difficulty level adjusts automatically to your progress.\n\nEIGHT DIFFERENT COMMAND TOOLS\nIn addition to a few helpful user tools, you can instruct your tuxedoed charges to walk, turn, wait and jump as you maneuver them to safety.\n\nTONS OF TRAPS AND OBSTACLES TO OVERCOME\nA variety of obstacles, including falling cages, broken ice, moving bridges, bloodthirsty wolves and more!\n\nADORABLE GRAPHICS\nEvery visual component is wonderfully hand-drawn. Yes, that includes the penguins!\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.3+\n\n\n                                   By bobiras2009\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:682b0d70d692c03c80647f6190f47598f1f5c8a9","amp;dn":"Arctic+Escape+HD+v1.0+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"682b0d70d692c03c80647f6190f47598f1f5c8a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,43,13,112,214,146,192,60,128,100,127,97,144,244,117,152,241,245,200,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
