The album has come to be regarded as U2's first overtly political album, in part because of songs like &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, &quot;New Year's Day&quot;, as well as the title, which stems from the band's perception of the world at the time; Bono stated that &quot;war seemed to be the motif for 1982.&quot;[1]\n\nWhile the central themes of their earlier albums Boy and October focused on adolescence and spirituality, respectively,[2] War focused on both the physical aspects of warfare, and the emotional after-effects.[1] Musically, it is also harsher than the band's previous releases. The album has been described as the record where the band &quot;turned pacifism itself into a crusade.&quot;[3]\n\nWar was a commercial success for the band, knocking Michael Jackson's Thriller from the top of the charts to become the band's first #1 album in the UK. It reached #12 in the U.S. and became their first Gold-certified album there. War has received critical acclaim. In 2012, the album was ranked number 223 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.[4]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b51d7f10391ce3e35ef5029eb3bee8ba93c4d41f","amp;dn":"U2+-+War+%5B1983%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b51d7f10391ce3e35ef5029eb3bee8ba93c4d41f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,29,127,16,57,28,227,227,94,245,2,158,179,190,232,186,147,196,212,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
