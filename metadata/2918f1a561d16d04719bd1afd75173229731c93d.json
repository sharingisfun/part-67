And whether you have a phone, a tablet or anything in between, the UI just feels right for the screen you are holding in your hands.\n\nAdditional Features:\n\n    Due date reminders\n    Widgets\n    Multiple Google accounts\n\nWhat's in this version: (Updated : May 28, 2012)\n\n    Expandable notifications for Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)\n    Adjustments for 7&quot; tablets (like Nexus 7)\n    If you have a hardware keyboard, you can just start typing to create a new task\n    Minor bug fixes\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.2+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2918f1a561d16d04719bd1afd75173229731c93d","amp;dn":"Tasks+v1.3.3+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2918f1a561d16d04719bd1afd75173229731c93d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,24,241,165,97,209,109,4,113,155,209,175,215,81,115,34,151,49,201,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
