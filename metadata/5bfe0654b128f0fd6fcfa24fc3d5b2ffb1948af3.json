On several tracks there is a very quiet guitar accompaniment, provided by Finian de Brun, but much of the music is entirely unaccompanied, except for occasional outbursts from an understandably excited audience. The playing is truly magnificent, and while several sets will be familiar from other recordings Tommy made in the 1970s, the sheer exuberance and technical precision is rarely matched on any of his other albums. Particularly excelllent here are the versions of 'The Green Hills of Tyrol' and 'The Green Fields of Glentown', while 'Jenny's Welcome to Charlie' is an absolutely superb rendition, played with all the Donegal fire and brilliance for which Tommy Peoples so rightly became famous. Yet another wonderful recording that has yet to be re-released on CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bfe0654b128f0fd6fcfa24fc3d5b2ffb1948af3","amp;dn":"Tommy+Peoples+-+An+Exciting+Session+With+One+Of+Ireland%27s+Leadin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bfe0654b128f0fd6fcfa24fc3d5b2ffb1948af3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,254,6,84,177,40,240,253,111,207,162,79,195,213,178,255,177,148,138,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
