Often in programming books, the information can be hidden in a vast sea of words. As a programmer who has over the years used a dozen programming languages, the author understands it can sometimes be difficult to slog through another 1,000-page book of dense text to learn a new language. There are likely many other programmers who feel the same way. To address this situation, this book explains C# 5.0 using figures; short, focused code samples; and clear, concise explanations.\n\nFigures are of prime importance in this book. While teaching programming seminars, Daniel Solis found that he could almost watch the light bulbs going on over the studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ heads as he drew the figures on the whiteboard. In this text, he has distilled each important concept into simple but accurate illustrations. The visual presentation of the content will give you an understanding of C# thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not possible with text alone.\n\nFor something as intricate and precise as a programming language, however, there must be text as well as figures. But rather than long, wordy explanations, Solis has used short, concise descriptions and bulleted lists to make each important piece of information visually distinct.\n\nBy the end of this book, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have a thorough working knowledge of all aspects of the C# language, whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a novice programmer or a seasoned veteran of other languages. If you want a long, leisurely, verbose explanation of the language, this is not the book for you. But if you want a concise, thorough, visual presentation of C# 5.0, this is just what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for.\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n\n    Details of the C# 5.0 language presented in a clear, concise treatment\n    New features in the latest version of .NET, version 4.5, in the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique visual style\n    How C# differs from and is similar to other programming languages, aiding migrating C++ and VB programmers who already know how languages work\n\nWho this book is for\n\n    Visual Basic programmers interested in moving to C#\n    C++ programmers interested in moving to C#\n    Novice programmers interested in learning C#\n    Students in introductory programming classes learning C#\n\nTable of Contents\n\n    C# and the .NET Framework\n    Overview of C# Programming\n    Types, Storage, and Variables\n    Classes: The Basics\n    Methods\n    More About Classes\n    Classes and Inheritance\n    Expressions and Operators\n    Statements\n    Structs\n    Enumerations\n    Arrays\n    Delegates\n    Events\n    Interfaces\n    Conversions\n    Generics\n    Enumerators and Iterators\n    Introduction to LINQ\n    Introduction to Asynchronous Programming\n    Namespaces and Assemblies\n    Exceptions\n    Preprocessor Directives\n    Reflection and Attributes\n    Other Topics\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e090ae68a57df1e4b4aaa3e2bed508bae1de0f54","amp;dn":"Illustrated+Csharp+2nd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e090ae68a57df1e4b4aaa3e2bed508bae1de0f54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,144,174,104,165,125,241,228,180,170,163,226,190,213,8,186,225,222,15,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
