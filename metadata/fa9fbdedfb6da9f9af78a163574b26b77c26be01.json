Starting as a weekly in the mid-1920s, the magazine is now published 47 times per year, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York and USA. It is well known in its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copy editing; its journalism on world politics and social issues; and its famous, single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue.\n\n\nThe New Yorker - January 2nd 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 84 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - January 9th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 86 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - January 16th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 88 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - January 23rd 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 94 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - January 30th 2012\nPDF | English | 84 Pages\n\nThe New Yorker - February 6th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 86 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - February 13th &amp; 20th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 144 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - February 27th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 106 pages \n\nThe New Yorker - March 5th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 96 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - March 12th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 94 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - March 19th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 98 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - March 26th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 124 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - April 2nd 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 84 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - April 9th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 90 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - April 16th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 136 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - April 23rd 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 88 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - April 30th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 86 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - May 7th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 86 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - May 14th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 144 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - May 21st 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 88 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - May 28th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 94 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - June 4th &amp; 11th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 160 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - June 18th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 92 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - June 25th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 90 pages \n\nThe New Yorker - July 2nd 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 90 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - July 9th &amp; 16th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 118 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - July 23rd 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 86 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - July 30th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 88 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - August 8th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 86 pages\n\nThe New Yorker - August 13th &amp; 20th 2012\nEnglish | PDF | 118 pages\n\nInitial seeding this.The faster you share the faster you get.So,seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa9fbdedfb6da9f9af78a163574b26b77c26be01","amp;dn":"The+New+Yorker+-+January+%7E+August+20th+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa9fbdedfb6da9f9af78a163574b26b77c26be01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,159,189,237,251,109,169,249,175,120,161,99,87,75,38,183,124,38,190,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
