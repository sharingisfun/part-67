He nabs Elango (Tarakaratna), but the attacks continue. The team has to dig deep before it finds those responsible. \n\nMovie Review: &quot; Yaar&quot; is a psychological thriller with decent performances from the entire cast. Children going missing are commonly heard, but this one takes it a step ahead with unborn children being abducted from wombs. Strange as it may, the movie leaves you convinced that such acts are a possibility provided you have some one as scheming as Elango. \n\nScreens n Sample Attached\n\nKeep Seeding...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cedc2fad613f0d3a3a08d0f85452dcfc474ddd05","amp;dn":"Yaar+%5B2012%5D-+Tamil-+480p-DvDrip-x264-Stalin.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cedc2fad613f0d3a3a08d0f85452dcfc474ddd05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,220,47,173,97,63,13,58,58,8,208,248,84,82,220,252,71,77,221,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
