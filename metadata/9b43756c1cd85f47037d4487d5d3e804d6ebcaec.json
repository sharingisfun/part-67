Danson is excellent in this role, making one believe in his character throughout.\nI also have the mpg version, 6 Gb total (two times 3 Gb), at 29 fps. This is much smoother with better crispness, and I will u-l it if there is any interest. \n\n\nF I L E  I N F O\n\nTITLE............GulliverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Travels\nYEAR.............1996\nGENRE............Adventure / drama\nRUNTIME..........3 hrs. 7 min. combined \nIMDB URL......... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115195/\n\nAUDIO............96 Kbs (2 chnls) 16 kHz sampling rate\nVIDEO............1008 Kb/s AVI type 25.000 FPS\nFORMAT...........DIVX / MP3\nLANGUAGE.........English\nRESOLUTION.......720 x 480\nFILES............2\nSIZE.............Part One 739 Mb (775,674,966 bytes) \n                 Part Two 747 Mb (783,650,594 bytes)\nSOURCE...........NTSC VHS tape\n\nN O T E S\n\nCOUNTRY..........USA\nDIRECTOR.........Charles Sturridge\nSCREENWRITER.....Simon Moore\nAuthor...........Jonathan Swift\nCAST.............Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, Peter OToole, Omar Sharif, James Fox\nSTUDIO...........20th Century Fox\n\nDanson portrays Gulliver, the 18th century physician who takes eight event-packed years to return home.
