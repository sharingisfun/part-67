Something goes terribly wrong and the resulting explosion unleashes a tsunami that slams into the tropical island of Kontiki destroying it completely. At the same time, 2,000 miles away in Siberia, the town of Moltov is swallowed by a giant sinkhole. Scientists at the U.S. Geological survey are at a loss to explain the events. The only possibility is that a previously ignored warning from disgraced geologist, Brian Gordon suggests that, a disruption within the Earth's mantle beneath the Mid-Oceanic Ridge could cause a chain reaction of such massive proportions that it would tear the entire planet apart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a9151c980357c07e0e53b1d18352aa3f80377c2","amp;dn":"Deep+Core+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a9151c980357c07e0e53b1d18352aa3f80377c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,145,81,201,128,53,124,7,224,229,59,29,24,53,42,163,248,3,119,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
