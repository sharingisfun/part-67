While not a replacement for full fledged antivirus software, Stinger is updated multiple times a week to include detection for newer Fake Alert variants and prevalent viruses.\nStinger is a standalone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses. It is not a substitute for full anti-virus protection, but rather a tool to assist administrators and users when dealing with an infected system. Stinger utilizes next-generation scan engine technology, including process scanning, digitally signed .DAT files, and scan performance optimizations. It detects and removes threats identified under the Ã¢â‚¬Å“List VirusesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ icon in the Stinger application.\n\n\n                                  By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dc7f5478e847469da9fd8bc5b3c413867a4d42f","amp;dn":"McAfee+Stinger+10.2.0.752+Final+%5BWindows%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dc7f5478e847469da9fd8bc5b3c413867a4d42f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,199,245,71,142,132,116,105,218,159,216,188,91,60,65,56,103,164,212,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
