Helmer, &quot;Al Capone and His American Boys: Memoirs of a Mobster's Wife&quot;\n English | ISBN 10: 0253356067 | 2011 | PDF | 400 pages | 7.8 MB\n\n When her husband was murdered on the orders of Chicago mobster Frank Nitti, Georgette Winkeler -- wife of one of Al Capone's &quot;American Boys&quot; -- set out to expose the Chicago Syndicate. After an attempt to publish her story was squelched by the mob, she offered it to the FBI in the mistaken belief that they had the authority to strike at the racketeers who had killed her husband Gus. Discovered 60 years later in FBI files, the manuscript describes the couple's life on the run, the St. Valentine's Day Massacre (Gus was one of the shooters), and other headline crimes of that period. Prepared for publication by mob expert William J. Helmer, Al Capone and His American Boys is a compelling contemporary account of the heyday of Chicago crime by a woman who found herself married to the mob.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9e6c86ee5ef3c0e58c358d1b9f1ffe339512a70","amp;dn":"Al+Capone+and+His+American+Boys-+Memoirs+of+a+Mobster%27s+Wife.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9e6c86ee5ef3c0e58c358d1b9f1ffe339512a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,230,200,110,229,239,60,14,88,195,88,209,185,241,255,227,57,81,42,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
