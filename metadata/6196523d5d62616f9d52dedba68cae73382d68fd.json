His show will continue to air on the Liberty Radio Network, but beginning Monday his live broadcast will be on the No Agenda Stream. The show will be shortened from three hours to two, and he expressed his intention to follow the No Agenda business model of listener support only with no commercials [at least during the live broadcast]. I got the impression that he may insert commercials into a la Jack Blood. My hope is that he won't bend the rules like Jack and start sneaking them into the live show. But I'm sure he'll do what he needs to do to keep going, and I have editing software.\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6196523d5d62616f9d52dedba68cae73382d68fd","amp;dn":"Scott+Horton+Show+-+2012+Aug+17+FR+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6196523d5d62616f9d52dedba68cae73382d68fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,150,82,61,93,98,97,111,157,82,222,219,166,140,174,115,56,45,104,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
