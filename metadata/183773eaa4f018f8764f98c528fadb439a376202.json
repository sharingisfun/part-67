Notably (at least some\nversions of) VLC doesn't detect the audio track well at all.\nMedia Player Classic has no problem whatsoever.\nThe practical says - convert the audio to MP3, since AVI\ndoesn't do AAC well. But then I'd have to create a moniker\nand take credit for actually doing something here.\nBut MP3 is somewhat standard for AVI, so why not?\nCreate an external MP3 audio file with instructions on use?\n\nSearch TPB for &quot;Chelsea.Lately.2012.08.15&quot; and see what it's like.\nAVI - X264 / AAC encoding with a separate MP3 audio track.\n\nAny thoughts?\nYes, there IS a short pier here ... why? \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:183773eaa4f018f8764f98c528fadb439a376202","amp;dn":"The.Daily.Show.2012.08.16.HDTV.x264-FQM.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"183773eaa4f018f8764f98c528fadb439a376202","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,55,115,234,164,240,24,248,118,79,152,197,40,250,219,67,154,55,98,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
