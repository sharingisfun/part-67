If you want to make them into a pdf file and reupload, GO FOR IT! :D\n\n\nBook Description:\n\nBased on the concept of learning to draw animals by starting with a single line (head and backbone), this volume provides tips on drawing animals without having to go through the steps of practicing complicated skeletal and muscular structures. The book faithfully traces techniques from drawing, realistic images to techniques of deformation used to make figures appear cute and cuddly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6bdc7928b859ff86fbc81fe2909348ef10d15e5","amp;dn":"How+to+Draw+Manga+Vol.+36+-+Animals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6bdc7928b859ff86fbc81fe2909348ef10d15e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,189,199,146,139,133,159,248,111,188,129,254,41,9,52,142,241,13,21,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
