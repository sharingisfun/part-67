No good will come of your investigation,&quot; says Nanny Tess to David Ash, paranormal investigator, in this disappointing horror tale. An associate of the Psychical Research Institute, Ash visits Edbrook, a lonely mansion in the British countryside, at the behest of the Mariell siblings--Christina, Robert and Simon--playful, immature children in grown-up bodies, and their aunt, Nanny Tess, all of whom have seen ghosts and strange sights aplenty in their ancestral home. Ash, who has a reputation as a skeptic and debunker, wonders if a deliberate attempt to discredit him is taking place (or is his incipient alcoholism catching up with him?) when he follows a ghostly figure through the grounds to a small garden pond. He is pushed, held underwater--and sees a pale figure with open arms. . . . What are the ghastly secrets of Edbrook's history? Of Ash's? Only slightly buoyed by Ash's fond remembrances of seances past.\n\n\n                               Format 1 - Epub\n\n                               Format 2 - Mobi\n\n\n\n             **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac3574120e43604148b4455ad65f1fa4709f84b8","amp;dn":"Haunted+by+James+Herbert+%28David+Ash+Book+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac3574120e43604148b4455ad65f1fa4709f84b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,53,116,18,14,67,96,65,72,180,69,90,214,95,31,164,112,159,132,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
