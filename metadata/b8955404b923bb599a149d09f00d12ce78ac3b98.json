Gustav Vasa, fearing for his life and discovery by the Danish troops, spoke to an assembly of men in Mora, aiming to convince them to raise a levy and start a rebellion against king Christian of Denmark. The men did not want to fight for those reasons so on his skiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, Gustav Vasa started to make his way towards Norway, to find refuge there, when two Mora brothers on skiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s caught up with him in SÃƒÂ¤len. The men in Mora had changed their minds after hearing that the Danish rulers had decided to raise taxes, and they now wanted Gustav to lead the rebellion.On the 6th of June 1523, Gustav Vasa was crowned king of Sweden, having beaten the Danish king Christian. Sweden has been fully independent ever since.\n\nVasaloppet is the oldest, the longest, and also considered the biggest cross-country ski race in the world. In the 80th race, held on 7 March 2004, some 15,500 skiers competed in the main event. The course starts in SÃƒÂ¤len where Gustav Vasa was caught by the brothers and passes through beautiful taiga forests, villages, marsh lands and lakes before finishing 90km away in the picturesque city of Mora.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize____: 1.70 GB\nRun-Time____: 4 hours 47 minutes\nContainer___: M4V - ipod compatible (tested)\nVideo_______: x264 CAVLC Baseline L3.0 640x360 25fps CRF 26\nAudio_______: AAC-LC 64Kbps ABR 2 channels 44.1KHz\nLanguage____: English\nCommentators: Michael Craig and Martin Larsson\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8955404b923bb599a149d09f00d12ce78ac3b98","amp;dn":"Skiclassics+Vasaloppet+%282012-03-04%29+Webrip+x264+AAC+640x360+iPod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8955404b923bb599a149d09f00d12ce78ac3b98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,149,84,4,185,35,187,89,154,20,157,9,240,13,18,206,120,172,59,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
