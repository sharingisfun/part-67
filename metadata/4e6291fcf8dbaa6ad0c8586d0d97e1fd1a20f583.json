RachelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family had accused Israel of intentionally and unlawfully killing their 23-year-old daughter, launching a civil case in the northern Israeli city of Haifa after a military investigation had cleared the army of wrongdoing. In the ruling issued by the court yesterday, Judge Oded Gershon called CorrieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death a &quot;regrettable accident,&quot; but said the state was not responsible because the incident had occurred during what he termed a war-time situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e6291fcf8dbaa6ad0c8586d0d97e1fd1a20f583","amp;dn":"Scott+Horton+Show+-+2012+Aug+29+WE+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e6291fcf8dbaa6ad0c8586d0d97e1fd1a20f583","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,98,145,252,248,219,170,106,208,200,88,109,13,151,225,253,26,32,245,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
