Encyclopedic in both layout and range, this is an ideal consolation gift for those who have stopped, an ideal aide de memoire for those who might, and a defiant puff of libertarian brilliance for those who wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Celebrate the Hollywood age of smoking when film stars lit up with glamorous abandon. Witty, illustrated, collectible, and up-to-date.\n\n&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ All smokers know that cigarettes are dangerous. Each one is a dance with deathÃ¢â‚¬â€and the defiant smoker will say that therein lies its charm. So each puff is an existential gesture, an assertion of choice and life in the face of death.&quot;\n\nOne day the last cigarette on earth will be smoked. One final puff will be sent heaven-bound, leaving a lingering, evanescent smoke ring. And the wise of this world will rejoice. Because logic demands that mankind is rid of this pernicious poison. And wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t that well-known logician Adolf Hitler the most virulent opponent of cigarette smoking in the last century? Until then, read this book. 50 black-and-white illustrations\n\nAbout the Authors\nEducated at Trinity College Oxford, Chris Harrald has enjoyed a varied smoking career.
