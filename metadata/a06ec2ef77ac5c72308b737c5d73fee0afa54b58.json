It was created at the end of the 50Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s, which also gained fame because of its peculiarity of the Dick DaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s style of playing guitar. With an agressive and heavy style, the MMMafia brings the old way of playing the guitar along with the brilliant trumpet and aggressive beats. This has created its own identity, called Power Surf Music. Modern melodies and contemporary style mark the musicians of the band, formed by Verme on the guitar (ex-Happy Cow), Moloncio on the trumpet (ex-Skacaos), Bolinha on the bass (ex-Happy Cow) and Emiliano Ramirez on the drums. The first single of MMMafia, called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Power Surf OrchestraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was recorded during the second half of January, 2009, and it was produced by the already known and famous Celso Rocha. The MCD, which has four songs composed, will be launched by Orleone Records and will be available during the 14th edition of Psycho Carnival, in Curitiba.\n\nInfo:\n\nDogs Of The Seas Album:\n\n01 Break Beach\n02 The Wave Of Seven Days\n03 Neptune's Fury\n04 Surf No Limits\n05 Surfing With The Gypsies\n06 Hawaii\n07 Samurai\n\nSite:\n\n\n\nThis is the second album of the band! please seed! those are awesome songs!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a06ec2ef77ac5c72308b737c5d73fee0afa54b58","amp;dn":"The+Mullet+Monster+Mafia+-+Dogs+Of+The+Seas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a06ec2ef77ac5c72308b737c5d73fee0afa54b58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,110,194,239,119,172,92,114,48,139,115,124,93,115,254,224,175,165,75,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
