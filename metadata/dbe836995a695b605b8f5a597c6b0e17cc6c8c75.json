He\nhad been dreaming of this project for 15 years, and when it came through, all he had to do was pack his bags and co me to\nIndia and shoot for 20 months. Sounds easy! But, for Wood, it was the most daunting task to condense such a vast history\ninto six hours, yet say it all with feeling and factual accuracy. With this series he has drawn more than his usual fans into the\nmagical ring that only he is capable of creating. Says Wood: Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was a big responsibility. We love India so much, even six\nhours seemed not enough. We wanted to do much more. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to get back to India again and do a Nataraja series.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbe836995a695b605b8f5a597c6b0e17cc6c8c75","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+India","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbe836995a695b605b8f5a597c6b0e17cc6c8c75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,232,54,153,90,105,91,96,91,143,90,89,124,107,14,23,204,108,140,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
