He goes to a country where his mother probably is, but nobody there like foreigners and he is hunted by a bunch of boys, until he discovers the house of  Kalsan, an old lady that lives with her daughter Helena (Barbora Bobulova) and doesn't hate foreigns as the others. But Kalsan resists to shelter Mirka and help him to find his mother. But Mirka will convice her to stay there, otherwise he doesn't have where to go and will be killed. Meanwhile Helena, the young and gorgeous that was raped during an old war (she was 13) , starts to suspect that this xenophobia has gone too far, and is held by the mysticism and irracionalism. She believes that Mirka is one of the boys that were born (and should had been killed) by the violation from the intruders.\n\nThis cinema is starred by Vanessa Redgrave, Gerard Depardieu, Franco Nero, Barbora Bobulova, and Karim Benhadj (I guess a relative of the director, in the role of Mirka). Filmed in a impressive bucolic italian landscape Mirka is a touching drama about the horrors of wars, mainly the rape and sexual crimes. It will certanly  make you think about these days.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b92c6dfcd042bb7d080c4f4fd7efa03d3bb80416","amp;dn":"Mirka","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b92c6dfcd042bb7d080c4f4fd7efa03d3bb80416","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,44,109,252,208,66,187,125,8,12,79,79,215,239,160,61,59,184,4,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
