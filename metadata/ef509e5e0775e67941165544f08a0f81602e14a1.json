Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef509e5e0775e67941165544f08a0f81602e14a1","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+21+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef509e5e0775e67941165544f08a0f81602e14a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,80,158,94,7,117,230,121,65,22,85,68,240,138,15,129,96,46,20,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
