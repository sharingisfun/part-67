Todd and Brant were enclosed nearly 1000 metres underground, caged in a space so small they could neither sit up straight nor fully lie down. It was five days before they were found to be alive. Most Australians know that Todd Russell and Brant Webb survived a horrifying mine collapse that killed their colleague Larry Knight. However, they dont know much more than that. Beaconsfield tells the whole story. After the discovery that Todd and Brant had survived the mine collapse the search became a rescue mission. Working in conditions that could see another cave-in at any moment, colleagues worked tirelessly to get them out alive. It was an event Australia and the world watched unfolding with bated breath. As every news outlet in the country scrambled to cover the story, the frantic work of the rescuers continued. Beaconsfield recounts the story of these two very different men who were trapped together for 15 days while their wives, families and friends waited anxiously above ground, hoping and praying for good news. It tells how Matthew Gill, Pat Ball and their teams rescued Todd Russell and Brant Webb. But most of all, it is the story of how two men, who had nothing in common, kept their heads together and their hope alive for 15 days and nights. \n\nGenre: Drama \nIMDB Rating: 7.8/10 \nDirected by: Glendyn Ivin \nStarring: Shane Jacobson, Lachy Hulme and Cameron Daddo \n\nRelease Name: Beaconsfield.2012.DVDRip.XviD-aAF \nSize: 2 CD \nVideo: XviD, 624 x 336, 1520 kb/s \nAudio: English, AC3, 224 kb/s \nRuntime: 1:51:05","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22294e048736d122ffc8d93921cd84f4bdc707ec","amp;dn":"Beaconsfield.2012.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22294e048736d122ffc8d93921cd84f4bdc707ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,41,78,4,135,54,209,34,255,200,217,57,33,205,132,244,189,199,7,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
