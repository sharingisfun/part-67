No single service provided photographers with a complete set of tools that allowed them to connect with others in a rich, meaningful wayÃ¢â‚¬â€œuntil now.\n\nUnlike other social networks, Google+ allows photographers to upload, personalize, and update images easily. The Google+ interface is intuitive and attractiveÃ¢â‚¬â€images appear large and uncropped in the stream, preserving their original integrity; and the infinite scrolling feature creates a fluid, enjoyable photo browsing experience. In addition, the Google+ interface is built to encourage social interaction, not in miniature sound bites, but in full-length discussions with diverse groups of people. Users can build circles to connect with just those they want to include in different conversations, and they can use the Hangouts feature to talk with other users in real time from anywhere in the world.\n\nWith this book, you'll see why Google+ has quickly become the most inspiring and interactive social network for photographers, and you'll learn how to leverage Google+ to build a following and connect with other photographersÃ¢â‚¬â€œand potential customers.\n\n    * Explains how to effectively showcase your work for the vibrant and growing Google+ photography community\n    * Shows how to upload, organize, and share your images; and hone your skills through photo-critique circles\n    * Features interviews with leading photographers who share their own photos and tips on how to make the most of Google+ to build an online presence\n\n\n# Paperback: 224 pages\n# Publisher: Peachpit Press; 1 edition (March 29, 2012)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0321820401\n# ISBN-13: 978-0321820402","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9037958785cd5ccaee48f324bd1c3a17901d51ce","amp;dn":"Google%2B+for+Photographers+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9037958785cd5ccaee48f324bd1c3a17901d51ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,55,149,135,133,205,92,202,238,72,243,36,189,28,58,23,144,29,81,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
