Credit to the original uploader.****\n\n\nThe closest I can get to describing hearing Admiral Sir Cloudesley ShovellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music for the first time is that it was akin to the aural equivalent of stumbling into an 18 year-old maleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bedsit in 1973.\n \nStatus Quo, Budgie and Black Sabbath albums are piled on top of the hi-fi; torn centrefolds from Playbirds and Whitehouse are Sellotaped to the walls; Richard AllenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sSuedehead, William BurroughsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Junkie and Francis KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sexuality, Magic &amp; Perversiontumble from the window sill; crushed Courage Light Ale cans and Players No 6 packets form a tower in the corner; filthy, tight-fitting T-shirts and patched-up denim bell bottoms are strewn all over the floor. And there, in the centre, like a Biblical king surveying his domain, is the music lover Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a stick-thin, back street Jesus, engrossed in the rolling of his last spliff, flowing hair all but obscuring his chops, the opening bars of The GroundhogsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœCherry RedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ blowing from the speakers around him like a sucker-punch from Heaven.\n \nGet the picture? Good. The Shovell, as their friends and fans know them, belong spiritually to a time and place weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d all like to believe still exists somewhere Ã¢â‚¬â€œ maybe thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why their no-nonsense take on the progressive metal sound of the early-mid Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s is so damn accessible. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need a degree in doom-rock or a Masters in metal for their incorrigible clatter to strike a (power) chord Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you just need ears, feet and some appreciation of what makes bands and music GOOD.\n \nSome statistics: the Shovell are named after a 17th century English naval commander; Bill Darlington plays drums and is too thin, Louis Comfort-Wiggett plays bass without his glasses falling off and Johnny Gorilla plays guitar and shouts, both loudly; they have been together as a band since 2008 and mates for donkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s years; their lineage includes more neo-psych, garage, freakbeat and powerpop combos than you could shake a stick at; there are people in Catalunya, Spain still recovering from the ShovellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s May 2009 tour there; their 2011 Rise Above 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬ËœReturn To ZeroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢/Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Day After DayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, sold out instantly and now commands up to Ã‚Â£100 a copy; their debut long-player will tear your face off and put it back on inside out, using spit.\n \nOK, so that last bit may be open to conjecture but make no mistake Ã¢â‚¬â€œ DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Hear ItÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Fear It! (available on CD and gatefold vinyl with bonus Ã¢â‚¬Å“Euro styleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ 45 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ oh yes) finds the Hastings threesome delivering the kind of greasy hard-rock thrills rarely heard in this climate of blind nostalgia and misjudged authenticity. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard Ã¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ heavy, without the marshmallow; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old-fashioned yet so NOW that it hurts; it has three songs on side one and four on side two; it has yer actual Tony McPhee off of the aforementioned Groundhogs on it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a rock Ã¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll album made by people who give two shits and whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve earned just a little Ã¢â‚¬Å“meÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ time in the company of your ears.
