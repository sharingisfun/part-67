Pola Negri plays DuBarry, who sleeps her way to the court of King Louis XV (Emil Jannings), ultimately becoming his mistress. Comes the revolution, and the rabble demands DuBarry's head. This gives Negri plenty of opportunity for strenuous histrionics as she's led to the guillotine. Small wonder that this film was retitled Passion for its American release.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Madame DuBarry.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,494,222,848 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:53:47\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 656x480 (AR: 1.367)\nFPS .................................................: 20.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1551 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.246 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002423/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0002423/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSilent, with French and German intertitles.
