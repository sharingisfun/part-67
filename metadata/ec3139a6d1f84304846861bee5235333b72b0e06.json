Cute but geeky Kate (Elaine Hurt) has a crush on Paul (Patrick Delgado), a good looking guy who works at the grocery where her family shops, and when she attends SpaceCon (an event for comic, sci-fi and fantasy fans) with her friends, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pleased to see heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s there as well. Kate is even happier when Paul wants some private time with her, but a kiss gives way to a bite on the neck, and Kate learns that Paul isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pretending to be a vampire like many folks at the Con, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the real thing. Paul became a blood sucker after a run-in with Vince (Devin Bonnee), an angst-y vampire the ladies swoon over, but both Paul and Kate have mixed feelings about being creatures of the night. When KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pal Jason (Santiago Dietche), who carries a torch for her, puts together the pieces and realizes whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happened, he sets out to rescue Kate from the vampires before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late. My Sucky Teen Romance was written and directed by Emily Hagins, who was just eighteen years old when the project was wrapped; it received its world premiere at the 2011 South by Southwest Film Festival\n\n\nSize: 322755277 bytes (307.80 MiB)\nDuration: 01:16:46\nSource: doridro\n\nNice Print\n\nMust Watch\n\nEnjoy\n\nAlways Entertainment\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/5164/89966333.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/5164/89966333.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreen shots\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/9716/vlcsnap2012090512h49m51.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/9716/vlcsnap2012090512h49m51.png&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/1066/vlcsnap2012090512h47m14.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/1066/vlcsnap2012090512h47m14.png&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/4471/vlcsnap2012090512h47m49.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/4471/vlcsnap2012090512h47m49.png&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/1230/vlcsnap2012090512h47m55.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/1230/vlcsnap2012090512h47m55.png&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/4398/vlcsnap2012090512h49m40.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/4398/vlcsnap2012090512h49m40.png&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec3139a6d1f84304846861bee5235333b72b0e06","amp;dn":"My+Sucky+Teen+Romance+2011+DVDRIP+Pankhabd.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec3139a6d1f84304846861bee5235333b72b0e06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,49,57,166,209,248,67,4,132,104,97,190,229,35,83,51,183,43,14,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
