Actors Sue Cleaver (Eileen Grimshaw), Ryan Thomas (Jason Grimshaw), Brooke Vincent (Sophie Webster) and Ben Price (Nick Tilsley) travel to Kenya on a mission to put on a play with the aim of educating people about the dangers of HIV. Working with a local charity and using their soap experience the four have just two weeks to recruit actors, rehearse and perform their new soap-inspired work. In a country where over 70,000 people lose their lives to the disease every year the pressure is on to draw in the crowds and leave the audience with a life-changing message.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f2872cffae63a2d52cf45a860562c347fc8bc9e","amp;dn":"Corrie+Goes+to+Kenya+PT1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f2872cffae63a2d52cf45a860562c347fc8bc9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,40,114,207,250,230,58,45,82,207,69,168,96,86,44,52,127,200,188,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
