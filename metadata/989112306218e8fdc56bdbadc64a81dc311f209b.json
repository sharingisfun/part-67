Amongst these are a middle-aged couple who met through the classified ads in a newspaper, a call-girl who keeps her daughter and her sister, a retired actor, an ex-football player, and a janitor who suspects that his adopted father, whom he dreams about every night, is his real father. The subject of this documentary is private life in the big city, apartments as a last stronghold of individuality, in addition to emphasizing the fact that to live together in one and the same place does not ensure that a community will be formed.\n\n\nSubs srt: English / French / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:989112306218e8fdc56bdbadc64a81dc311f209b","amp;dn":"Edificster+2002+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"989112306218e8fdc56bdbadc64a81dc311f209b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,145,18,48,98,24,232,253,197,107,219,173,198,74,129,220,49,31,32,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
