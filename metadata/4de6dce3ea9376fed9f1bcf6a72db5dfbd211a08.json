What compels people to respond to devastating, unpredictable eventsÃ¢â‚¬â€terrorist acts, wars, natural disasters, economic upheavalsÃ¢â‚¬â€with the conviction that nothing is a coincidence, nothing is as it seems, and everything is connected?\n\n\nConspiracy Rising: Conspiracy Thinking and American Public Life argues that while outlandish paranoid theories themselves may seem nonsensical, the thread of conspiracy thinking throughout American history is a both a byproduct of our democratic form of government and a very real threat to it. From the Illuminati, the Knights Templar, and the Freemasons to the government hiding aliens and faking the moon landing; from the New World Order to the Obama &quot;Birthers,&quot; the book explores the enduring popularity of a number of American conspiracy theories, showing how the conspiracy hysteria that may provoke disdain and apathy in the general public, can become a source of dangerous extremism.\n\n\nFiles:\n\nConspiracy Rising ; Conspiracy Thinking and American Public Life .pdf\n[i950].txt\nCover.jpg\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/i950&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/i950&lt;/a&gt;\n\nZERO VIRUS : CLEAN COPY : FALSE POSITIVE MIGHT OCCUR\n\n\nDon't forget to Seeeeeeeed...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4de6dce3ea9376fed9f1bcf6a72db5dfbd211a08","amp;dn":"Conspiracy+and+American+Public+Life+%5Bi950%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4de6dce3ea9376fed9f1bcf6a72db5dfbd211a08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,230,220,227,234,147,118,254,217,241,188,246,167,45,181,223,189,33,26,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
