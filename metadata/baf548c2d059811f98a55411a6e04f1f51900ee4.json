But 90 day's stretched into five years, and a short term science mission searching for evidence of water has turned into one of the greatest adventures of the space age. The rovers have trekked miles across hostile plains, climbed mountains, ventured in and out of deep craters, survived dust storms and mechanical failures, and cheated death so often that no one will venture a guess as to how much longer they might last.   \n    Five years on Mars follows this amazing story of two rovers that have explored vast reaches of Mars and may be among some of the greatest explorers in history.    \n\nINFO: \nResolution- 720x480 \nFrame Rate- 29.97fps \nPixel Shape- 10:11(NTSC 4:3) \nVideo Structure- Progressive \nDuration- 95min, 46 seconds \nSize: 970mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baf548c2d059811f98a55411a6e04f1f51900ee4","amp;dn":"Five+Years+on+Mars%28National+Geographic%29%7Bdvdripmp4%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baf548c2d059811f98a55411a6e04f1f51900ee4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,245,72,194,208,89,129,31,152,165,84,17,166,224,79,31,81,144,14,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
