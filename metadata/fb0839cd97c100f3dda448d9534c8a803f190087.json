They have grasping arms and tentacles attached to an uncanny, alien intelligence. Flashing in a code we cannot decipher, they are sea monsters with grim appetites. As mysteriously as they appear, these Humboldt squid disappear for months. Now an obsessed scientist and an intrepid cameraman team up to grapple with the mysteries of the creature known as the red devil, a beast that can reach six feet long. Join underwater cameraman Bob Cranston, who has spent more time than anyone else in the world at depth with the jumbo squid, as he studies these DEVILS OF THE DEEP.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1925 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 624x472\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.322:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 53:37.080\nNumber Of Parts: 14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb0839cd97c100f3dda448d9534c8a803f190087","amp;dn":"NG.Wildlife.Wonders.12of14.Humboldt.Squid.Devils.of.the.Deep.Xvi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb0839cd97c100f3dda448d9534c8a803f190087","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,8,57,205,151,193,0,243,221,164,72,217,83,76,138,128,63,25,0,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
