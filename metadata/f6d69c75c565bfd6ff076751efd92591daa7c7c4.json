Drawing on both the western swing of his young-adult years and the hard-and-fast rules of traditional fiddling, he created a clean, intricate style that turned fare such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jack Of DiamondsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Billy In The LowgroundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ into a whole Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnother thing (he also contributed at least one modern standard, the lush waltz Ã¢â‚¬Å“Midnight On The WaterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). ThomassonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s celebrated long-bow technique yielded a sweeping, smoother sound that rendered obsolete the slurs of Appalachian fiddling. He varied the traditional warhorses Ã¢â‚¬â€ but not too much Ã¢â‚¬â€ by playing slight variations on the melody, and by turning conventional two-part fiddle tunes into multi-part extravaganzas. And he tailored his music to the contest format, developing a distinct repertoire that was unlike what he might play at social gatherings (where the audience would be less concerned with judge-pleasing technique and more attuned to something that got them dancing). Because Thomasson was never a commercial performer, these twenty tracks (including two live) from 1966 to 1969 are the backbone of his recorded output Ã¢â‚¬â€ definitely a feast for fiddle fanatics, albeit more like eat-your-broccoli fare for many others. - John Morthland","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6d69c75c565bfd6ff076751efd92591daa7c7c4","amp;dn":"Benny+Thomasson%3A+Legendary+Texas+Fiddler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6d69c75c565bfd6ff076751efd92591daa7c7c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,214,156,117,197,101,191,214,255,7,103,81,239,217,37,145,218,167,199,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
