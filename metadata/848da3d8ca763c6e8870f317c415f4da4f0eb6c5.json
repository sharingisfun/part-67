These games are for custom firmwares \n\nonly (Jailbroken PSPs)! If you don't have any custom \n\nfirmware installed, then these games won't work!\n\nTo play, you will need to put the files from the &quot;PSP Games&quot; \n\nfolder in the &quot;ISO&quot; folder which can be found in the root of \n\nyour PSP's memory card after plugging the USB cable. If \n\nyou don't have the &quot;ISO&quot; folder, then simply make a new \n\nfolder in the root of your PSP and rename it to &quot;ISO&quot;. Don't \n\nforget to put the games in the folder to play!  \n\nI currently have a slow internet connection for which, it may \n\ntake a bit more time to upload it completely. So please be \n\npatient!  \n\nIf you have any other problems, then don't hesitate to put \n\nyour comments below.  \n \nThank You, Have Fun &amp; Please Seed! :) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:848da3d8ca763c6e8870f317c415f4da4f0eb6c5","amp;dn":"Top+72+PSP+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"848da3d8ca763c6e8870f317c415f4da4f0eb6c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,141,163,216,202,118,60,110,136,112,243,23,196,21,244,218,79,14,182,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
