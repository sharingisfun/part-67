Simon is Irena, the ghost of her father's first wife, who nine out of ten cats prefer. Marvellously eloquent, and touchingly accurate in accessing the secret landscape of a child's mind.\n\nUSA - RKO Pictures - B&amp;W - 1944.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71ccc6e6393d2bbb1ba214c620a875afb773197b","amp;dn":"Curse+of+the+Cat+People+%281944%29+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71ccc6e6393d2bbb1ba214c620a875afb773197b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,204,198,230,57,61,43,187,27,162,20,198,32,168,117,175,183,115,25,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
