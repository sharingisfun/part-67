When the former head of the Christian Coalition was discovered to have raked in millions of dollars from the super lobbyist Ã¢â‚¬â€ and eventually convicted felon Ã¢â‚¬â€ Jack Abramoff, Reed wound up in political purgatory. But outraged by the election of Barack Obama, and responding to what he describes as GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s call (via Sean Hannity), Reed returned to start the Faith and Freedom Coalition with the aim of toppling Barack Obama from the White House. To succeed, Reed needs to win the allegiance of many of the trusting Christian followers he had duped and double-crossed while working with Abramoff.\n\nThis week, Moyers &amp; Company tracks ReedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rise, fall, and return: does it signal a new revolution, or an old racket?\n\nLater on the show, Bill talks with Mike Lofgren, a long-time Republican who describes modern corruption and dysfunction in both the Republican and Democratic parties. LofgrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new book is The Party is Over: How Republicans Went Crazy, Democrats Became Useless, and the Middle Class Got Shafted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a94c050186f72e2304c12e8ca7e567d7aac8010","amp;dn":"The+Resurrection+of+Ralph+Reed+Moyers+and+Company+083112-PBS+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a94c050186f72e2304c12e8ca7e567d7aac8010","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,148,192,80,24,111,114,226,48,76,18,232,202,126,86,125,122,172,128,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
