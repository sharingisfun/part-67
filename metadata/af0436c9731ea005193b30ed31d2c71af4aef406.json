It consists of\nvideos I collected over the time. If all the videos\nare playing and Windows shows a thumbnail in the\nexplorer for every video then your codecs and\nsettings are working.\n\nI think there is every container format with all\nthe codecs and audio codec combinations I can think\nof.\n\nIf you wonder about some videos. They are there\nbecause the where videos where i maybe had no\nsound, thumbnail or other problems.\nWell some are there because I like them.\n2 Girls 1 Sub is definitely one of them :-)\n\nNaming convention:\n\nThe files are sorted by codec until the files with\nthe prefix x, y and z. The prefixes are there to\ncombine different types of videos.\n\nxSubCha: Different kinds of videos with subchapters.\n\nyMTS: The official Matroska Test Suite. This files\n      have errors but should play without crashing\n      and to the end. There is a description for\n      every video in the Matroska Test Suite.txt\n\nz1-z14: This videos are the real deal. They are\n        almost sorted by how much they push your\n        hardware.\n        z8 and z13 are the real CPU killer.\n\n\nRelease Notes\n====================================\nv1.1 - 2012-07-12\n- Initial Release\n- file size 13.2 GB [you can download single files]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af0436c9731ea005193b30ed31d2c71af4aef406","amp;dn":"Skulltronics+Codec+Test+Compilation+%28CTC%29+v1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af0436c9731ea005193b30ed31d2c71af4aef406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,4,54,201,115,30,160,5,25,59,48,237,49,210,199,26,244,174,244,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
