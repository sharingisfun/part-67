(and subsequent offshoots) is a Japanese psychedelic band, the core of which formed in 1995.[1] The band is led by guitarist Kawabata Makoto and early in their career featured many musicians, but by 2004 the line-up had coalesced with only a few core members and frequent guest vocalists.\n\nThe band has released albums frequently on a number of international record labels as well as the Acid Mothers Temple family record label, which was established in 1998 to document the activities of the whole collective.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPirates, sharing is caring!
