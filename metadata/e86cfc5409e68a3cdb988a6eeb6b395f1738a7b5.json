Six years after leaving home, he returned as an undercover reporter for The Guardian, working at a call center in Delhi in 2004, a time when globalization was fast proceeding and Thomas L. Friedman declared the world flat. DebÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experience interviewing the call-center staff led him to undertake this book and travel throughout the subcontinent.\n\nThe Beautiful and the Damned examines IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many contradictions through various individual and extraordinary perspectives. With lyrical and commanding prose, Deb introduces the reader to an unforgettable group of Indians, including a Gatsby-like mogul in Delhi whose hobby is producing big-budget gangster films that no one sees; a wiry, dusty farmer named Gopeti whose village is plagued by suicides and was the epicenter of a riot; and a sad-eyed waitress named Esther who has set aside her dual degrees in biochemistry and botany to serve Coca-Cola to arms dealers at an upscale hotel called Shangri La.\n\nLike no other writer, Deb humanizes the post-globalization experienceÃ¢â‚¬â€its advantages, failures, and absurdities. India is a country where you take a nap and someone has stolen your job, where you buy a BMW but still have to idle for cows crossing your path. A personal, narrative work of journalism and cultural analysis in the same vein as Adrian Nicole LeBlancÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Random Family and V. S. NaipaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s India series, The Beautiful and the Damned is an important and incisive new work.\n\nThe Beautiful and the Damned is a Publishers Weekly Best Nonfiction title for 2011.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e86cfc5409e68a3cdb988a6eeb6b395f1738a7b5","amp;dn":"The+Beautiful+and+the+Damned+A+Portrait+of+the+New+India.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e86cfc5409e68a3cdb988a6eeb6b395f1738a7b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,108,252,84,9,230,138,60,219,152,138,110,235,107,57,95,23,56,167,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
