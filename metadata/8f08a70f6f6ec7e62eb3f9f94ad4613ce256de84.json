Hadley (AgentParsec). It shares the same gameplay elements as the original - you must collect 8 pages while avoiding the enemy. This is not intended to be a copy - simply a way for people who loved Slender to be able to face their fear on a different map with the same awesome gameplay. There are some differences which will make playing a somewhat unique experience - different AI, new sounds, and a different environment.\n\nVersion 1.31","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f08a70f6f6ec7e62eb3f9f94ad4613ce256de84","amp;dn":"Slender+-+Sanatorium+v1.31","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f08a70f6f6ec7e62eb3f9f94ad4613ce256de84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,8,167,15,111,110,199,230,46,179,249,249,74,212,97,60,226,86,222,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
