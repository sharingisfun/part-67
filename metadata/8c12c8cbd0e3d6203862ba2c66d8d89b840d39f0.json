DMB received a great reception from the audience. \n\nHighlights of the show include a classic Warehouse with supporting vocals from Carter and, as always, one-of-a-kind playing from LeRoi. Hard hitters from the show include Tripping Billies, Pay For What You Get and a solid rendition of Help Myself. Minarets features Carter and DaveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scatting intro and ends with its typical feverish finish with a segue into Typical Situation. What Would You Say is funky and tight and keeps the crowd hollering. Ants ends the show with a rousing finish. The 3.2.94 show has been digitally mastered and is available in its entirety. \n\nEnjoy.\nSeed.\n\nFrom Demonoid that sadly has failed to, well, TPB :)\n\nTrackers to add:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cpleft.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cpleft.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sline.net:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sline.net:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nudp://tracker.istole.it:6969\n\nudp://tracker.ccc.de:80\n\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce\n\nudp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce\n\nudp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce\n\n\n******************************************************\n\n-Doubzstep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c12c8cbd0e3d6203862ba2c66d8d89b840d39f0","amp;dn":"DMBLive+Masquerade+Nightclub%2C+Tampa%2C+FL+3%2F2%2F1994+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c12c8cbd0e3d6203862ba2c66d8d89b840d39f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,18,200,203,208,227,214,32,56,98,186,44,102,216,216,155,132,13,57,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
