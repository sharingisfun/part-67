A little of the dialogue is in Braid Scots, which is even more in need of subtitles.\n\nThe story (set in 1770) is about the daughter of a chief who marries her off to a fur-trader for the sake of alliance and prestige. Needless to say, the marriage is anything but smooth. Then smallpox comes along to compound problems...\n\nThis thing was apparently performed by aboriginals from Seymourville, Manitoba - I think they do a very nice job. Hazel King has the biggest chore, she is as good as a professional actress. See for yourself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed658994f69a3ebe321f24d1fd5af011bd336878","amp;dn":"Ikwe+%281987%29+Ojibway-language+Hazel+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed658994f69a3ebe321f24d1fd5af011bd336878","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,101,137,148,246,154,62,190,50,31,36,209,253,90,240,17,189,51,104,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
