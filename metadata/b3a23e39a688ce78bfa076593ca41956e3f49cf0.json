These files where originally posted on Demonoid.  Since the demise of the site, I decide to repost for all.  This is for all those Red Dwarf fans.\n\nLooks like 2012 is not the end of the world .  Hope it continues so we can get to see the new season coming out this fall. Well then here are the magazines full of gossip, details, interviews and some funny comic strips.\n\nFrom Wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dwarf#Magazine\nThe Red Dwarf Magazine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the magazine part of the title changed to &quot;Smegazine&quot; from issue 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was launched in 1992 by Fleetway Editions. It comprised a mix of news, reviews, interviews, comic strips and competitions. The comic strips featured episode adaptations and original material, including further stories of popular characters like the Mr. Flibble, Polymorph and Ace Rimmer.\n\nHad these magazines a long time ago, but lost them. Thru luck was able to find some scans. Found them in one of the DCP group or comic request packages. So thanks to whoever in the digital comics world did the work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3a23e39a688ce78bfa076593ca41956e3f49cf0","amp;dn":"Red+Dwarf+%28tv+show%29+Magazines%2FSmegazines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3a23e39a688ce78bfa076593ca41956e3f49cf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,162,62,57,166,136,206,120,191,160,118,89,60,164,25,86,227,244,156,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
