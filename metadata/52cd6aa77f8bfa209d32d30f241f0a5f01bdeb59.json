What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 12 - Sunday - It's Finals week! The judges announce to the top six contestants that they must run lunch service for 60 guests at Guillaume at Bennelong under the watchful eye of head chef Guillaume Brahini. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52cd6aa77f8bfa209d32d30f241f0a5f01bdeb59","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E67.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52cd6aa77f8bfa209d32d30f241f0a5f01bdeb59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,205,106,167,127,139,250,32,157,50,211,15,36,31,10,95,1,189,235,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
