The touch screen interface elegantly replaces the mouse and all of the original tense and paranoid gameplay is bought straight up to date with this new portable version. Stay mobile, trust nobody, don't get caught.\n\nYou're an Uplink Agent - a freelance computer hacker who makes a living by performing jobs for major corporations. Break into classified computer systems, steal research data, sabotage software, change academic and criminal records, even frame innocent people. Just be sure to cover your tracks, and remember that trust is a weakness.\n\nPraise for the PC Version:\n\n    A stroke of genius...a must for all conspiracy fiends&quot; PC Gamer -- 80%\n    A true original...paranoia has never been so much fun&quot; PC Format -- 81%\n    Deeply, deeply, deeply compulsive...try it&quot; Games Master - 80%\n\nHardware requirements: screen height of 480px or greater, total pixel count of 500,000 or greater. 6.5&quot;+ screen size strongly recommended.
