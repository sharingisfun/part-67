It was based on the eponymous series of books by Janet and Allan Ahlberg which were illustrated by Andre Amstutz and focused on the adventures of a gang of skeletons. There was the Big Skeleton (whose catchphrase was &quot;Good idea!&quot;), the Little Skeleton, (who was the brains of the outfit), and the Dog Skeleton. Each episode was 5 minutes in length.\n\nA BBC video entitled &quot;FunnyBones - Bumps in the Night&quot; which contained all 12 episodes was released soon after the series ended\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
