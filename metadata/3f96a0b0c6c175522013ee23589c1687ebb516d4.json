Fraps is now compatible with Windows 7 and the latest DirectX 11 games.\n\nVentrilo &amp; TeamSpeak users have long wanted a way to record their microphone and speakers at the same time.  \nFor Windows 7 and Vista we've added realtime sound mixing to our video recording so you can now capture\nboth sides of the conversation!\n\nNVIDIA have recently included stereoscopic 3D support directly into their drivers.  \nIf you play your DirectX9 (D3D9) game with 3D Vision enabled you can use Fraps to record the game in full 3D too!  \nYou'll get a side-by-side stereo AVI recording that you can drop straight in to a stereoscopic 3D\nplayer!\n\nFinally, we are aware that more and more people are putting Fraps to professional use.  \nWe've added a new option to force lossless RGB compression to ensure that you always have the highest\nquality video output to work with.\n\nFraps 3.5.7 - 14th August, 2012\n- Fixed audio sync in long recordings for Windows XP users\n- Fixed problem taking screenshots from DWM even with counter on screen\n- Fixed 64-bit DirectX 11 games always being recorded in lossless RGB\n- Fixed corruption in video when audio source set to 11.25kHz\n- Other minor bug fixes\n\nSupported OS:\nWindows XP, 2003, Vista and Windows 7\n\n\n                                  By bobiras2009\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f96a0b0c6c175522013ee23589c1687ebb516d4","amp;dn":"Fraps+v3.5.7+Build+15516+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f96a0b0c6c175522013ee23589c1687ebb516d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,150,160,176,198,193,117,82,32,19,238,35,88,156,22,135,235,181,22,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
