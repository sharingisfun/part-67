Too many reviewers worry about the avant-garde nature of the Yoko Ono performance. The film documents one of the best and most feral rock concerts ever given. Lennon's performance is raw and exciting. And, if you've ever doubted Lennon's estimation of &quot;Don't Worry Kyoko...&quot; as one of the best rock songs ever, you must see him and Clapton getting into a fine guitar groove that works like a mantra. And the live version of &quot;Yer Blues&quot; is as exciting as the performance in the Stones' &quot;Rock and Roll Circus&quot; (not to mention &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;! This is a classic moment in rock history that testifies to the power of Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band.\n\nJohn Lennon &amp; The Plastic Ono Band Live In Toronto Ã¢â‚¬â„¢69 is a rare look at one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most influential popular artists at a pivotal moment in his career. Filmed on the eve of the release of the Abbey Road LP Ã¢â‚¬â€ the last Beatles album to be recorded Ã¢â‚¬â€ this is the only performance ever caught on film of John Lennon &amp; the Plastic Ono Band. It had been three years since Lennon had performed onstage with The Beatles. Seemingly on a whim, John and wife Yoko Ono hopped on a plane with guitarist Eric Clapton, bassist Klaus Voormann and drummer Alan White to travel to the Toronto Rock Ã¢â‚¬â„¢NÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Roll Revival festival showcasing some of LennonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early musical heroes Ã¢â‚¬â€ among them Bo Diddley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. As it turned out, Lennon and the newly formed Plastic Ono Band played an equally significant role that night in the history of rock Ã¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll, as it is widely believed this concert foreshadowed the official end of The Beatles. Captured by Academy AwardÃ¢â‚¬â€œnominated director D.A. Pennebaker (The War Room, DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Look Back, Monterey Pop), this concert film serves as one of the great historical documents in the career and life of John Lennon.\nDVD Features: NTSC Keep Case Audio: Dolby Digital 5.1 - English Additional Release Material: Interviews: Yoko Ono - 1988 Tracks: 1.
