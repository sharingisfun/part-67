Roddenberry, Rick Berman, and Michael Piller served as executive producers at different times throughout the production. The show was created 21 years after the original Star Trek show and set in the 24th century, about 100 years after the original series. The program features a new crew and a new starship Enterprise. Patrick Stewart's voice-over introduction during each episode's opening credits stated the starship's purpose, updated from the original to represent an open-ended &quot;mission&quot;, and to be gender-neutral:\n \n\nSpace: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n00:00:00.000                             : :Episode 01-02  Encounter at Farpoint\n01:30:18.272                             : :Episode 03       The Naked Now\n02:15:02.848                             : :Episode 04       Code of Honor\n02:59:44.448                             : :Episode 05       The Last Outpost\n03:44:30.496                             : :Episode 06       Where No One Has Gone Before\n04:29:15.040                             : :Episode 07        Lonely Among Us\n05:13:57.120                             : :Episode 08       Justice\n05:58:40.224                             : :Episode 09       The Battle\n06:43:21.344                             : :Episode 10       Hide and Q\n07:28:02.464                             : :Episode 11       Haven\n08:12:46.112                             : :Episode 12       The Big Goodbye\n08:57:28.224                             : :Episode 13       Datalore\n09:42:11.584                             : :Episode 14       Angel One\n10:26:53.184                             : :Episode 15       11001001\n11:11:34.976                             : :Episode 16       Too Short a Season\n11:56:16.672                             : :Episode 17       When the Bough Breaks\n12:41:01.984                             : :Episode 18       Home Soil\n13:25:44.256                             : :Episode 19       Coming of Age\n14:10:23.808                             : :Episode 20       Heart of Glory\n14:55:06.976                             : :Episode 21       The Arsenal of Freedom\n15:39:33.568                             : :Episode 22       Symbiosis\n16:24:14.848                             : :Episode 23       Skin of Evil\n17:08:55.488                             : :Episode 24       We'll Always Have Paris\n17:53:37.088                             : :Episode 25       Conspiracy\n18:38:18.272                             : :Episode 26       The Neutral Zone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f13e6094031fa7f1219b4893dea097290765ad09","amp;dn":"Star+Trek%3A+TNG+Season+One+Full+Quality+HDTV+1920x1080","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f13e6094031fa7f1219b4893dea097290765ad09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,62,96,148,3,31,167,241,33,155,72,147,222,160,151,41,7,101,173,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
