She is usually followed and harrased around by local boys, who, one day, decide to trash her brother's scooter for fun. The boys' father refuses to pay them back the price of the scooter. The fight for &quot;fair is fair&quot; takes the teens around the state and produces an unlikely hero. \n\n\nContainer: Matroska\nRuntime:   1h 35mn\nSize:      1.46 GiB\nDXVA:      Compatible\n\n\t\nVideoCodec:    x264\nResolution:    718x478 ~&gt; 849x478\nAspect ratio:  16:9\nFrame rate:    23.976 fps\nBit rate:      1 770 Kbps\n\t\nAudio: English 5.1ch AC-3 @ 384 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3464c7e568c0940c8e993bfc88138556838d560f","amp;dn":"THE_LEGEND_OF_BILLIE_JEAN.1985.HDTV.x264.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3464c7e568c0940c8e993bfc88138556838d560f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,100,199,229,104,192,148,12,142,153,59,252,136,19,133,86,131,141,86,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
