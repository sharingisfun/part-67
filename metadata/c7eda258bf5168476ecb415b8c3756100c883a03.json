She was bound for Stockholm but never arrived. Six hours into the stormy crossing, the 15,000-ton ship sent out a desperate Mayday communication. By interviewing passengers and crew and by analysing the official investigation into the accident, the evidence is pieced together to show how this tragedy took place and how, incredibly, 137 people managed to survive.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2242 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x464\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.552:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46:41.640\nNumber Of Parts: 10\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7eda258bf5168476ecb415b8c3756100c883a03","amp;dn":"DC.Zero.Hour.07of10.The.Sinking.of.the.Estonia.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7eda258bf5168476ecb415b8c3756100c883a03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,237,162,88,191,81,104,71,110,203,65,91,140,55,86,16,12,136,58,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
