Some of these were on only briefly, cancelled after a season or two. Others were on for much longer, and a handful are still on today.\n\nInspired by the earlier video &quot;30 Minutes of 90s Cartoon Openings&quot;, I decided to put together a compilation of TV shows I remember vividly from my childhood. Some of these I completely forgot until I looked them up on one of Wikipedia's lists. I hope you enjoy watching this as much as I enjoyed making it.\n\nPlease feel free to upload or redistribute this to any video site, filesharing site, etc. For copyright reasons, I'm uploading this anonymously.
