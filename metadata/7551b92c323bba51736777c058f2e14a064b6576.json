It's all based on &quot;muscle confusion&quot; -- a technique that constantly challenges your muscles with varying sequences of different exercises. All the workouts include carefully planned &quot;work&quot; and &quot;rest&quot; circuits (without specific rep counts -- you'll just do as much as you can in the time allotted). The exercises blend proven weight-room classics with newer &quot;functional fitness&quot; routines. The toning ranges from classic squats and bicep curls to multi-muscle training and and kettlebell-style moves. The aerobic intervals are short but intense (e.g. &quot;jump split lunges&quot; and &quot;high knee jogs&quot;). Tom Holland makes the most of his equipment -- he matches the dumbbell weight to the exercise and often uses the stability ball as a weight bench to improve range of motion. Requires a stability ball and two sets of dumbbells (e.g. 5 lb. and 10 lb.). Includes a nutrition booklet and &quot;90 day success chart.&quot; Ã‚Â©2010.
