The sound of these guitars must be heard live to be believed. The music is extremely heavy, fast, dark and violent while still incorporating a progressive touch of orchestral choirs, strings, and synth. You'll find no female vocals or flutes or other tired 'northern folk metal' dross here. Only spikes, nails, chains and leather are allowed. And this isn't just more chug-chug, dry sounding death metal either. This music is relentlessly extreme and has a definite ambience. Fans of the heaviest, most extreme metal need look no further.\n\nRead more here: http://www.playityet.com/artists/darklord/about\n\n\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01-Into The Lightless Realm          1:17\n02-Commota Est Et Contremuit Terra   2:35\n03-Appearance of the Spirit          0:16\n04-Prince of the Land of Tears       2:44\n05-I Summon Thee                     1:48\n06-Opening of the Seventh Gate       0:55\n                                     ----\n                                     9:35\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65e2567c56a820c724d59ba9661e98430cefa8d3","amp;dn":"Darklord+-+...by+the+force+of+sacred+magic+rites...+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65e2567c56a820c724d59ba9661e98430cefa8d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,226,86,124,86,168,32,199,36,213,155,169,102,30,152,67,12,239,168,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
