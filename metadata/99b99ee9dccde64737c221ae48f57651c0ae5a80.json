Most of these caves are no long caver-friendly due to this guide, so my guess is you will not be welcome when you show up and try to go in these caves.  This guide also caused a lot of vandalism to these caves, so use with care and in any case I doubt the cave owners will let you go in these caves any more, and many of them are gated.  If you decide to use this guide, however, expect your car to be towed while you are in the cave and you to be arrested for trespassing after you come out of the cave.\n\nWith all that said, I think this guide should still be available to the public.\n\ncheers!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b99ee9dccde64737c221ae48f57651c0ae5a80","amp;dn":"Spelunkers+Guide+to+the+Caves+of+Garri.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b99ee9dccde64737c221ae48f57651c0ae5a80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,185,158,233,220,205,230,71,55,194,33,174,72,245,118,81,192,174,90,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
