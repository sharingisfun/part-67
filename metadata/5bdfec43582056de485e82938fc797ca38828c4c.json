I am leaving in my edit a sample of what was being broadcast on the stream while Scott thought he was &quot;on the air.&quot; From then on, everything seemed to go smoothly. He played more music than I was expecting to hear. I will be editing most of that out, because the reason I listen to this show is to hear the commentary and interviews.\n\nScott's guests on today's show were journalist Gareth Porter [ipsnews.net] and Lew Rockwell [lewrockwell.com] -- blogger, podcaster, Chairman of the von Mises Institute and VP of the Center for Libertarian Studies.\n\nRemember, Scott's show is now reduced from three hours to two hours in length, and apparently will be live Monday through Wednesday and on Friday. The timeslot on Thursday is taken by the No Agenda show.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to\n share information that counters the monotone of mainstream\n corporate media. \n\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.
