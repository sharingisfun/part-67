National Geographic cameras follow the family during a two-year Arctic odyssey filled with touching and unforgettable moments, many never before filmed. Watch in wonder as curious cubs emerge from their den for the first time after a three-month hibernation. Go 'ice-crashing' with the polar bear family as they hunt for seals. Feel the tension as the mother protects her cubs from a hostile male, one of many dangers lurking on the ice floes. Just half of all cubs survive beyond their first year, and this polar bear family needs the mother's finely tuned instincts - and luck - to beat the odds.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1925 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 624x472\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.322:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 53:37.080\nNumber Of Parts: 14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8939a6855f08c43f369e6403f15d4f5d343c7810","amp;dn":"NG.Wildlife.Wonders.09of14.Realm.of.the.Great.White.Bear.XviD.AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8939a6855f08c43f369e6403f15d4f5d343c7810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,57,166,133,95,8,196,63,54,158,100,3,241,93,79,93,52,60,120,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
