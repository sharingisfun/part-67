Coming up on 15 years since they first started playing, Yellowcard are clearly at the point in their lives when teenage ambitions have long since given way to adult realizations. In that sense, while Yellowcard's songs still retain the youthful, emo-rock enthusiasm and catchy melodicism that marked the best of their earlier work, there is a weightiness and expansive gaze to many of the songs on Southern Air.
