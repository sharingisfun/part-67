It tells the story of Annie, a teenage girl, who receives a horse as an unexpected inheritance from her grandfather. It is kept in the stables of Rosemond Hills, the estate that once belonged to her grandparents.\n\nThe game is shaped as an adventure title with a storyline (finding out why her family lost the estate), different locations, conversations with other characters and puzzle elements. The main focus is however on the horse racing/caring element. With the help of John the stable keeper Annie has to learn how to train her horse and perform various activities to keep it in shape. After practising, completing various chores and progressing though the game, Annie receives invitations to compete at various trials and championships, with the main goal of beating her rival Melissa.\n\nThe riding consists of three disciplines: jumping, steeple chase and cross country. Dressage from the previous titles has been removed, as well as the option to play with four players in alternating sessions. The racing elements are presented in 3D with full control over the direction, speed and jumping abilities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67f77b9e85ebef13570de255332d0cb43691401c","amp;dn":"Arvet+fr%26aring%3Bn+Rosemond+hill+%28Legacy+of+Rosemond+hill%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67f77b9e85ebef13570de255332d0cb43691401c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,247,123,158,133,235,239,19,87,13,226,85,51,45,12,180,54,145,64,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
