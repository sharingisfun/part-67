We\njust want to point out one thing, and that is your framerate testing of\nour Prototype 2 proper.\n\nWhy should we believe your testing, when our own is totally different,\nand why does ours match users on public forums all over the net? Again,\nlike you yourself point out, using those as valid proof is a little\nweak, yet using own facts as proofs, is just hilarious, as you have no\nREAL technical or informations that those numbers you put in your funny\nstatement, is just imaginary facts. You can't prove your testing is\nreal.\n\nEvery cracker with a little knowledge will know that reversed is always\nbetter and faster. It has been that since scene beginning, and will\ncontinue to be so in the future.\n\nYes, there are some games with protections, that probably never would\nbe released, because reversing them will take a great deal of time to\ndo properly. We're not talking a couple of days of work, but rather a\ncouple of months work to do a proper reversed crack of those games.\nEspecially some Starforce games have lately been in that category, so\nrather a release to a certain point, rather than no release at all.\n\nWhen that is said, then Steam CEG protected games is fully reversable\nwithin a reasonable time, and we have time after time proved that to\nthe scene, so stop bullshitting that emulation is just as fast, and\njust as equal as an fully reversed exe. Suprise it's not!\n\nBut keep on releasing those emulation releases, that some users still\nwon't be able to run, because of your method. Remember we offered your\nSteam cracker help to do them properly.\n\nIn the end we will keep on propering your emulation work, so why not do\nthem the right way, rather than getting propered everytime? We even\ntold you to fix your Dirt Showdown release, but you can't, because your\nemulation method isn't far from perfect emulated.\n\nQuality has a price, but sadly you don't understand the terminology\nbehind the word.\n\nRELEASE NOTES\n\nGet ready to pull the trigger on a completely new chapter in the\naward-winning Hitman series. Be the ultimate assassin in the Hitman\nSniper Challenge by testing your reactions, focus and skill in a\nstand-alone hit available only for Hitman Absolution pre-purchases.\nUnlock weapons and upgrades that can be carried over into HITMAN:\nABSOLUTION and compare your scores with other players around the globe\nusing online leaderboards.\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n1.
