It is the second film in the Dhoom series. Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra star in the film as buddy cops Jai Dixit and Ali, respectively. The duo attempt to capture Mr. A (Hrithik Roshan), a professional thief whose passion is to steal rare and valuable collectibles using high-technology gadgets. The film was shot primarily in India, Durban, and Rio de Janeiro, becoming the first major Hindi film to be shot in Brazil. The film's distributor, Yash Raj Films, promoted the film by forging associations with Pepe Jeans and Coca-Cola. The film premiered on 24 November 2006 in India, where it received the widest release in Indian cinema history with over 1800 prints.\n\nDhoom 2 was generally well received by both critics and audiences. It became the highest-grossing Indian film of 2006,[3] and was the highest-grossing film of all time. It is the seventh highest-grossing Bollywood film in overseas markets.[4] After grossing over INR150 crore (US$27.15 million), the film was elevated to a &quot;blockbuster&quot; rating on Box Office India. It received an 80% approval rating among critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics praised Dhoom 2 for its exotic locales and elaborate action sequences. However, there was an appeal by the Mumbai city police commissioner to censor the fast-paced rash driving scenes in the film due to fears that it would inspire Indian youths to ride their motorcycles rashly, resulting in an increase in the number of road accidents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6c9c8015046d71866e5c3cdeaa06c8e22f69943","amp;dn":"Dhoom+2+2006+Hindi+720P+BRRip+x264+PakTeam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6c9c8015046d71866e5c3cdeaa06c8e22f69943","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,201,200,1,80,70,215,24,102,229,195,205,234,160,108,142,34,246,153,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
