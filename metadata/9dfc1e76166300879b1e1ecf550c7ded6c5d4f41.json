ParaNorman is, following Coraline, the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second stop-motion animated feature to be made in 3D. In ParaNorman, a small town comes under siege by zombies. Who can it call? Only misunderstood local boy Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who is able to speak with the dead. In addition to the zombies, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to take on ghosts, witches and, worst, of all, grown-ups, to save his town from a centuries-old curse. But this young ghoul whisperer may find his paranormal activities pushed to their otherworldly limits. \n\nGenre: Animation | Adventure | Comedy \nIMDB rating: 7.6/10 from 2,328 users \nDirected by: Chris Butler, Sam Fell \nStarring: Kodi Smit-McPhee, Anna Kendrick and Christopher Mintz-Plasse \n\nRelease Name: Paranorman 2012 TS XViD READNFO Ã¢â‚¬â€œ MATiNE \nSize: 713.13 MB \nQuality: XviD |720Ãƒâ€”304 | MP3 128kbps \nRuntime: 1h 25m","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dfc1e76166300879b1e1ecf550c7ded6c5d4f41","amp;dn":"Paranorman+2012+TS+XViD+READNFO.MATiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dfc1e76166300879b1e1ecf550c7ded6c5d4f41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,252,30,118,22,99,0,135,155,30,30,207,85,12,125,237,108,93,79,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
