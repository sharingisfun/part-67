According to the Van Halen Encyclopedia, the idea to re-record the album in Spanish was the idea of bassist Billy Sheehan, who had read an article in a magazine which reported that over half the Mexican population was between the ages of 18-27, a prime record buying market.[citation needed] Roth re-cut all his vocals with the help of a Spanish tutor in the studio. He changed around some of the racier lyrics, so as not to offend the more conservative Spanish-speaking population. With the exception of the vocals, the basic music tracks are the same as the &quot;Eat 'Em and Smile&quot; version, with the only exception being &quot;Big Trouble&quot;, which ends abruptly as opposed to fading out on the English version.\nAccording to Sheehan, the album wasn't well-received, with many people considering it &quot;gringo Spanish&quot;. Any future Spanish-version ideas were dropped. Sonrisa Salvaje was originally released on vinyl and cassette, but deleted almost immediately; a CD version did not appear until 2007. All of the liner notes on the original release were written in Spanish, except for the copyright notice and the Dolby noise reduction information on the cassette version.\nThe Spanish versions of &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; and &quot;That's Life&quot; were featured on the TV sitcom My Name is Earl in the episode &quot;South of the Border.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27e95cad221417e4bbfa3b76cc495aa64c6e056a","amp;dn":"David+Lee+Roth+-+Sonrisa+Salvaje+%281986%29+-+Album+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27e95cad221417e4bbfa3b76cc495aa64c6e056a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,233,92,173,34,20,23,228,187,250,59,118,204,73,90,166,76,110,5,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
