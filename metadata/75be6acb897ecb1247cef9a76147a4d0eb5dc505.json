It was written by comic duo David Walliams and Matt Lucas. The show's title is an amalgamation of the terms 'Little England' and 'Great Britain', and is also the name of a Victorian neighbourhood and modern street in London.[1]\n\nThe show comprises sketches involving exaggerated parodies of British people from all walks of life in various situations familiar to the British. These sketches are presented to the viewer together with narration in a manner which suggests that the programme is a guideÃ¢â‚¬â€aimed at non-British peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€to the ways of life of various classes of British society. Despite the narrator's description of great British institutions, the comedy is derived from the British audience's self-deprecating understanding of either themselves or people known to them.\n\nAn American continuation of the show, entitled Little Britain USA was broadcast in 2008. This series was shown on HBO in the US, HBO Canada in Canada, BBC One in the UK and on Network Ten in Australia, as well as various other television channels across the world.\n\nMany of the characters on the show have their own often-repeated catchphrases, which have become well known in the United Kingdom, and the show has gained a mainstream following\n\nAir date: 16 September 2003\nGenres: Comedy, Family, Sketch Improv \n\nFormat \tSketch comedy\nCreated by \tDavid Walliams\nMatt Lucas\nStarring \tDavid Walliams\nMatt Lucas\nTom Baker (narrator)\nCountry of origin \tUnited Kingdom\nNo. of series \t4\nNo. of episodes \t36 (List of episodes)\nProduction\nRunning time \t30 minutes\nProduction company(s) \tBBC\nBroadcast\nOriginal channel \tUK Series:\nBBC Three (Series 1 &amp; 2)\nBBC One (Series 3)\nOriginal run \t4 December 2003 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 31 December 2006\n\nRelease Date----- 2012-08-22\nRelease Size----- 60Mb\nSource----------- HDTV\nPlay Time-------- 00:29\n\nCompressed MP4 is better for sharing!\n\nGood video and audio quality\nEnglish audio\n\nPlease Seed back to make the speed Faster ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75be6acb897ecb1247cef9a76147a4d0eb5dc505","amp;dn":"Little+Britain+comedy+UK+S01+%28High+Quality+-+ENG%29mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75be6acb897ecb1247cef9a76147a4d0eb5dc505","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,190,106,203,137,126,203,18,71,206,249,167,97,71,164,208,235,93,197,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
