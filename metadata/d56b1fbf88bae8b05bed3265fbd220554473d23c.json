Since the\nCC2AVI process does not carry this info to the AVI - this doesn't matter.\nWhat matters is that the header information is rewritten so you no longer\nget an error.\n\nThere are a couple of items that still may not lend themselves to dissection\nand this makes MP4Muxer the only choice ...\nDemux, remux &amp; MP4Cam2AVI works ...\nFingers crossed.\n\nHave all those MP4 files and an old tablet that can't play them?\nWant to use your favorite AVI editing tools?\nWish you could back up frame by frame in Media Player Classic?\nNow you too can turn any MP4 encode into your favorite AVI.\n\n--------------------\n\nI NEVER claim an x264 encoding credit. I GIVE proper credit where due.\n\nMy offerings are clearly identifiable:\nuse search term &quot;x264.MP3*.avi&quot;\nuse search term &quot;MP4SUX&quot;\nWithout quotes for TPB.\nWith quotes for Google.\n\nMost of my offerings won't have &quot;MP4SUX&quot; in the name unless ...\nI do a re-encode OR I convert from a source web site (FLV mostly).\n\nMP4SUX\n\nNot just an opinion, a state of mind\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d56b1fbf88bae8b05bed3265fbd220554473d23c","amp;dn":"Pawn.Stars.S05E57.Fork.It.Over.HDTV.x264.MP3-EVOLVE.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d56b1fbf88bae8b05bed3265fbd220554473d23c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,107,31,191,136,186,232,176,91,237,50,101,251,210,32,85,68,115,210,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
