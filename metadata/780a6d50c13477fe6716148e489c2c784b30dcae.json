He also talks about built-in trapdoors in electronics manufactured in China. Stallman pioneered the concept of copyleft and he is the main author of the GNU General Public License. \n\nAlex also talks with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and war correspondent Chris Hedges. &quot;Revolt is all we have left. It is our only hope,&quot; Hedges recently wrote.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:780a6d50c13477fe6716148e489c2c784b30dcae","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Show+-+2012+Sep+05+WE+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"780a6d50c13477fe6716148e489c2c784b30dcae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,10,109,80,193,52,119,254,103,22,20,142,72,156,44,120,75,48,220,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
