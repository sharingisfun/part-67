Jubei is a masterless ninja who travels the land alone, hiring his services to those with gold...or a worthy cause. His fearsome abilities have served him well, but a hideous plot to overthrow the government threatens to end his wandering ways and possibly his life. \n\nWhen a small village succumbs to a terrible plague, a team of ninjas are sent to investigate, and realize that all is not as it seems. Ambushed, they are wiped out by a fearsome man-monster with incredible powers, leaving only one alive - Kagero, a beautiful female ninja, whose touch can bring instant death. Jubei saves her from a fate worse than death, and unwittingly becomes drawn into the web of treachery. He is soon faced with his greatest challenge, an enemy for whom death holds no fear, with the power to destroy Jubei's world. \n\n\nMovie Information\n\n\nYear:\t1993\n\nSource: Japanese Blu-Ray\n\nCategories:\t Action, Drama, Ecchi, Martial Arts, Ninjas, Samurai, Seinen, Violence,\n\nDirector:\t Yoshiaki Kawajiri \n\nProduction:\tMadhouse Studios MOVIC\n\n\nFile Information\n\n\nGroup:\t[R-R] \n\n\nVideo:\t 974x720, 23.976 fps, 10bit x264 (Hi10p)\n\nAudio:\t English AC3 5.1/Japanese AC3\n\nSubtitles:\t US DVD (English Softsubbed .ASS)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cececd263bcea3b549e9cad212b16f9d3c42b5ae","amp;dn":"%5BR-R%5D+Ninja+Scroll+%28720p.Hi10p.AC3%29+%5B61C66A0F%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cececd263bcea3b549e9cad212b16f9d3c42b5ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,206,205,38,59,206,163,181,73,233,202,210,18,177,111,157,60,66,181,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
