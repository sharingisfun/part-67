Why did Apple kicked our good &quot;old&quot; Macs??? I have an Early 2008 MacBook with 4 Gigs of RAM. I was angry. After a bit of researching and experimenting I found a solution. Now I want you guys to be able to use OS X 10.8 on your &quot;old&quot; Mac, too :D\n\nPS: Please do NOT copy this. This costed me over a week of hard working and experimenting and this is only the beta. I integrated some backdoors so i can see if some d*ckheads copy my work. That would NOT be nice and I would NOT try to do it. If you are smart and discovered something, you can mail me, but, again, please do NOT copy parts or more from my modded ML setup. This is only a warning. Now let's get back to work.\n\nCOMPATIBLE WITH:\nOpen System Profiler (in Utilities-Folder). Please keep in mind this is still beta and just for testing.\niUTA is tested with the following Macs:\n\n-Mac minis with X3100 &gt; fine\n-Mac Pros with upgraded graphics &gt; fine\n-MacBooks with X3100 &gt; Works, display brightness and sleep not working (yet)\n-MacBookAir with X3100 &gt; Works, display brightness &amp; sleep issue \n-MacBookPros with X1600 &gt; Graphics don't work really well, don't found compatible kexts yet\n-MacBooks with GMA 950 &gt; Works, some little issues\n-iMacs with GMA 950 &gt;Works, some little issues\n-iMacs with X1900 &gt; Graphics don't work really well, don't found compatible kexts yet\n-Mac Minis with GMA 950 &gt; Graphics don't work really well, don't found compatible kexts yet\n\nOther Macs aren't tested but MAY work! Please mail me about your experience with your Mac.\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0e677b7a6f23636f6d6760666f6d654e776f666161206d6163&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nFor everything after setupÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. :\n\n1. Software Update does NOT work (at the moment....keep in mind: beta). U have to download ur updates manually and then install 'em with Pacifist (google is ur friend)\n2. Some apps crashÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ u know, ur running ML on an officially unsupported Mac and iUTA is still in beta phaseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. I try my best to try out other kexts for making it more attractive for uÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Please contribute and help me making iUTA better.
