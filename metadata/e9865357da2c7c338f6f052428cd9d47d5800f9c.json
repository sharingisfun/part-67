A clear writing style explains how to sculpt an accurate human figure, starting with the skeleton and working out to muscle, fat, and skin. Insightful explanations enable you to quickly and easily create and design characters that can be used in film, game, or print, and allows you to gain a strong understanding of the foundational artistic concepts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9865357da2c7c338f6f052428cd9d47d5800f9c","amp;dn":"ZB_DSculpt_Human+Anatomy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9865357da2c7c338f6f052428cd9d47d5800f9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,134,83,87,218,44,124,51,143,111,5,36,40,205,157,71,213,128,15,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
