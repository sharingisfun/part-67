The six matches featured include the clash between Manchester City and Queens Park Rangers at the Etihad Stadium. It is a repeat of the fixture in which City dramatically clinched their first Premier League title, scoring two injury-time goals to defeat the Hoops 3-2 on the final day of last season. Despite losing at Eastlands, results elsewhere meant Rangers avoided relegation back to the Championship. QPR manager Mark Hughes, previously in charge of City, will once again try to get one over his former employers. \n\nElsewhere, newly-promoted West Ham take on London rivals Fulham, while Swansea host Sunderland. Tottenham look to avenge their shock defeat at home to Norwich last term, while West Brom meet Everton and Wigan face Stoke.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd417a4ff9c2c1745001f029a7161688900af573","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+01.09.2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd417a4ff9c2c1745001f029a7161688900af573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,65,122,79,249,194,193,116,80,1,240,41,167,22,22,136,144,10,245,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
