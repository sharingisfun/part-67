John Turturro plays Wooly, a simple, curiously odd bike messenger hoping to hear a bit of Ã¢â‚¬ËœspicyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ talk from Patti (Katherine Borowitz), an agoraphobic shut-in. Although each is not what the other hopes they will be, together they prove that wisps of enchantment can be found in even the most overlooked of hearts. And that hope takes on many unexpected shades.
