In this year 1961, on October 31, at 8:30 PM, a peak viewing time, begins in every house with a TV set (around 3,000,000 in those time, only black and white) a strange ceremonial: In order to get the (primitive) surround sound of the show as it'll be broadcast, the spectators have to tune a FM radio laid behind them to get the back sound, the front sound will come from the TV. During the past week they have been trained to proceed through trailers and announcements. Then begins seventy minutes of the weirdest moment one can imagine on a TV screen, unthinkable today: the oldest Greek tragedy The Persians, written by Aeschylus 2500 years ago, in the Leconte De Lisle's translation, sung and declaimed by a cast of the greatest French actors of the moment wearing strange masks and costumes, accompanied by an unusual musical score for the ears of the main part of the audience, all this in an unique and bare set: the tomb of an antique Persian king, and 6,000,000 French TV viewers hooked on it. The next days, it was on everyone's lips, press and critics comments were ecstatic. Two months later, a record of the soundtrack was released and it sold like hot cakes.
