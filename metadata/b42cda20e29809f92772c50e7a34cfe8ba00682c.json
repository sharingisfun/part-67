This was Gemini Suite, five long movements inspired by the members of Deep Purple, and performed live in September 1970 at the Royal Festival Hall with The Light Music Society Orchestra (the album of the concert was issued in 1993 as Gemini Suite Live). Jon Lord then recorded it in the studio as his first solo project in 1971, with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Arnold and soloists drawn from the rock world. Gemini Suite was an important step for Lord and led to albums such as Windows (1974) and Sarabande (1976).\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Guitar&quot; - Soloist: Albert Lee\n    &quot;Piano&quot; - Soloist: Jon Lord\n    &quot;Drums&quot; - Soloist: Ian Paice\n    &quot;Vocals&quot; - Soloist: Yvonne Elliman and Tony Ashton\n    &quot;Bass guitar&quot; - Soloist: Roger Glover\n    &quot;Organ&quot; - Soloist: Jon Lord\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b42cda20e29809f92772c50e7a34cfe8ba00682c","amp;dn":"Jon+Lord+-+Gemini+Suite+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b42cda20e29809f92772c50e7a34cfe8ba00682c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,44,218,32,226,152,9,249,39,114,197,14,122,52,207,232,186,0,104,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
