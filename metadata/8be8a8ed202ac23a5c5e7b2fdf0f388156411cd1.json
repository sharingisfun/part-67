Their music is born out of these sharecropping families who worked from sunup to sundown planting, hoeing and harvesting, and then played music at house parties in the evening, usually earning barely enough to survive.\n\n''This is the real thing! The Carrieres, like Bois Sec [Ardoin] and Canray [Fontenot], play Creole music, a rich cultural hybrid that sometimes sounds like Cajun music with a black sensibility and sometimes altogether more African.  It is the precursor of modern ZydecoÃ¢â‚¬Â¦The recordings were made near Lawtell, Louisiana in 1974 by Chris Strachwitz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bebe was 66 and Eraste 74. Both men were in excellent shape as musicians.  We can be grateful to Ron and Fay Stanford for 'discovering' the Carrieres, and to Chris Strachwitz for recording them.  Far too little old-time Creole music was recorded but the examples we do have are brilliant.  This is a must-buy for anyone with the slightest interest in old-time music in the broad sense of the word.''~Allin Cottrell (The Old-Time Herald)\n\n01. Zydeco de Carriere\n02.
