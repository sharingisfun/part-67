If you enjoy any of those acts, then you'll feel right at home with this EP. While it doesn't go over any new grounds, the EP should feel fresh and exciting to quite a few.\n\nDon't forget to seed, and support the artist by buying the EP here: http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/tenderly-flow-single/id494664698 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78c72ac4096e1994d62aa1cbfc2cf49e0a4735c7","amp;dn":"Disclosure%3A+Tenderly+%2F+Flow+%28EP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78c72ac4096e1994d62aa1cbfc2cf49e0a4735c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,199,42,196,9,110,25,148,214,42,161,203,252,44,244,158,10,71,53,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
