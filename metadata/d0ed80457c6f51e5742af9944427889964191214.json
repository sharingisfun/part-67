Here she meets the Munchkins and joins the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion on an unforgettable journey to the Emerald City, where lives the all-powered Wizard of Oz.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0ed80457c6f51e5742af9944427889964191214","amp;dn":"The+Wonderful+Wizard+of+Oz+%28Chinese+Language+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0ed80457c6f51e5742af9944427889964191214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,237,128,69,124,111,81,229,116,42,249,148,68,39,136,153,100,25,18,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
