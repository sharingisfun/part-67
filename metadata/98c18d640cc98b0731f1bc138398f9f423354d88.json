This\nfour CD box set of unreleased tracks, alternate versions of well known\nsongs, and rare concert footage is a cornerstone of any Hendrix\ncollection. This box set is no place to start if you are not familiar with\nHendrix. I would recommend his first three studio albums for any type of\nHendrix indoctrination. This set, however, is a good place to complete\nyour collection or at least to explore his legacy a little deeper.\n\n\n  01.
