Derek Anderson, Tony Delk, Walter McCarty, Ron Mercer, Nazr Mohammed, Mark Pope, Jeff Sheppard, Wayne Turner, and Antoine Walker.) and is argued by many to be one of, if not the best NCAA Basketball teams ever assembled.\n\nKentucky, coached by Rick Pitino, won the national title with a 76Ã¢â‚¬â€œ67 victory in the final game over Syracuse, coached by Jim Boeheim. Tony Delk of Kentucky was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Kentucky's run to the championship was one of the most dominant in NCAA tournament history, as the Wildcats won each of their first four games by at least 20 points and won every game by at least 7 points.\n\nFor more information on the 1996 NCAA BB tournament see below\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament&lt;/a&gt;\n\nP.S.
