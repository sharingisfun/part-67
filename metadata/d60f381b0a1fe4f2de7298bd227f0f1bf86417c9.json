History, literature, theology and the dynamic of a living, worldwide religious reality, all appropriately impinge on the study of Jesus. This book incorporates the most up-to-date historical work on Jesus the Jew with the 'bigger issues' of critical method, the story of Christian faith and study, and Jesus in a global church and in the encounter with Judaism and Islam.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d60f381b0a1fe4f2de7298bd227f0f1bf86417c9","amp;dn":"Cambridge+Companion+sus+%5BENG%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d60f381b0a1fe4f2de7298bd227f0f1bf86417c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,15,56,27,10,31,228,242,222,114,152,189,34,127,15,27,248,100,23,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
