Five men devoted to beating Bolt.\n They are: Jamaica's Yohan Blake, the current world champion,\n who is Bolt's training partner and strongest challenger; Asafa Powell,\n often the forgotten man of Jamaican sprinting, but still the last man to\n hold the world record before Bolt; Tyson Gay and Justin Gatlin, who \n lead the American charge hitting top form when it matters most; and \n Europe's best hope, the Frenchman Christophe Lemaitre, who is \n proving that white men can sprint and take on the very best.\n   This film follows the fortunes of the world's best sprinters as they\n prepare for that ultimate showdown at London 2012, from the\n supremely confident superstar Bolt to his focused, sometimes \n shy rivals, determined to prove that Bolt is just a man.
