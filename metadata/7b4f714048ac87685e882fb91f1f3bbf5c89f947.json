They have multiple commercial CDs available, and have played shows across the U.S.\n\nI received this small stack of CDs from a friend of a friend, and am now reposting online so it's not lost to time.  There are two live concerts - The OneUps BBQ2, and a live show at now-defunct JR's Lightbulb Club.  There are a handful of previously unreleased tunes in MP3 format, and there's a half-recorded WIP version of The OneUps Volume 2.\n\nLots of very rough, unpolished material here.  If the band allowed uploads to archive.org, that's a natural home for these.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b4f714048ac87685e882fb91f1f3bbf5c89f947","amp;dn":"The+OneUps+-+Live+%2F+WIP+%2F+Unreleased+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b4f714048ac87685e882fb91f1f3bbf5c89f947","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,79,113,64,72,172,135,104,94,136,47,185,31,31,59,191,92,137,249,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
