It is a completely free, fast-paced first-person shooter for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.\n\nSpeed and movement is what Warsow is all about. Like a true cyberathlete you jump, dash, dodge, and walljump your way through the game. Grab power-ups before your enemy does, plant a bomb before anyone sees you, and steal the enemyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flag before they know what is going on!\n\nOur goal is to offer a fast and fun competitive first-person shooter without hard graphical violence - Warsow has no blood or guts flying around. Red stars instead of blood indicate hits and colored cubes replace guts as gib effects.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.warsow.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.warsow.net&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2292a57417f964951294623948030f714761a08","amp;dn":"Warsow+v1.0+first-person+shooter+for+Windows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2292a57417f964951294623948030f714761a08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,41,42,87,65,127,150,73,81,41,70,35,148,128,48,247,20,118,26,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
