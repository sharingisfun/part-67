It peaked at #52 on the Billboard Hot 100, and at #37 on the pop singles chart in the United Kingdom.(4 wks)\n      &quot; Party Doll&quot;  is a song written by Mick Jagger and released on the album &quot;Primitive Cool&quot;. As the follow-up to Jagger's 1985 success &quot;She's the Boss&quot;, &quot;Primitive Cool&quot; was another attempt by Mick to make him a solo star, being more ambitious.  Released in September 1987 with &quot;Let's Work&quot; as the lead single, the commercial reaction to &quot;Primitive Cool&quot; was not as welcoming as the reception for &quot;She's the Boss&quot;, with the album merely reaching #26 in the UK and #41 in the United States.\n      &quot;Main Offender&quot; is the second studio album by Keith Richards and his last to date, released in 1992 in between The Rolling Stones'  &quot;Steel Wheels&quot; and &quot;Voodoo Lounge&quot; projects. When Richards would reunite with Mick Jagger  in mid-1993 to start work on Voodoo Lounge, Jagger would compliment Richards on &quot;Main Offender&quot;, even using lead single &quot;Wicked as It Seems&quot; as inspiration for The Rolling Stones' next single, &quot;Love Is Strong&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dc04fe25de6b094d47ef6fe43aa629eb3def4d9","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+398","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dc04fe25de6b094d47ef6fe43aa629eb3def4d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,192,79,226,93,230,176,148,212,126,246,254,67,170,98,158,179,222,244,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
