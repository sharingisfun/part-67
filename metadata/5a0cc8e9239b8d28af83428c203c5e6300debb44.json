Out of the ashes rose a new government, dedicated to maintaining order at any cost. The populace is controlled via government-sanctioned sex and drugs, a brutal police force known as the Blue Coats, and the slate, a mandatory implant that monitors every word a person speaks. To utter a forbidden, Red Listed word is to risk physical punishment or even death.\n\nBut there are those who resist. Guided by the fabled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Book of Noah,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they are determined to shake the people from their apathy, and are prepared to start a war in the name of freedom. The newest member of this resistance is HarperÃ¢â‚¬â€a woman driven by memories of a daughter lost, a daughter whose very name was erased by the Red List. And she possesses a power that could make her the underground warriorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ultimate weaponÃ¢â‚¬â€or the instrument of their destruction.\n\n\n\n\nFormats - Epub and Mobi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a0cc8e9239b8d28af83428c203c5e6300debb44","amp;dn":"Veracity+by+Laura+Bynum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a0cc8e9239b8d28af83428c203c5e6300debb44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,12,200,233,35,155,141,40,175,131,66,140,32,60,94,99,0,222,187,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
