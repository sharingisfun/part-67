Here, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re definitely going to pick out unique nuances of South African and East Africa (Uganda and Kenyan) music intonations.\nThe album features renditions of widely played and still fresh tunes like, Ã¢â‚¬Å“FeverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Besame MuchoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. And original, vernacular (Kikuyu) tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ngugi iiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hoi and HoiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are some of the highlights of this album. Here you can sense the great command of language (this being her native language- Kikuyu) as she belts outs these two incredible tunes to the listenerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appreciation.\nBottom line- this is a well crafted album which has the input of some of the best producers, artists and instrumentalists locally and internationally (Kenya, Uganda and South Africa).
