A king was a warrior who literally fought to win power then battled to keep it. Yet despite everything that stood in their way, a handful of extraordinary women did attempt to rule medieval and Tudor England. In this series, historian Dr Helen Castor explores seven queens who challenged male power, the fierce reactions they provoked and whether the term 'she wolves' was deserved.\n\n800 years ago, Matilda came within a hair's breadth of being the first woman to be crowned queen of England in her own right. Castor explores how Matilda reached this point and why her bid for the throne ultimately failed. Her daughter-in-law Eleanor of Aquitaine was an equally formidable woman. Despite being remembered as the queen of courtly love, in reality during her long life she divorced one king and married another, only to lead a rebellion against him. She only finally achieved the power she craved in her seventies.\n\nBBC She Wolves, England's Early Queens 1 of 3 Matilda And Eleanor 2012.avi\nFilesize......: 700Mb\nRuntime.......: 00:59:00\nVideo Codec...: XviD\nVideo Bitrate.: 1532Kbps\nFrame Size....: 624x352\nFrame Rate....: 25fps\nAudio Codec...: mp3\nAudio Bitrate.: 64bps\nAudio Freq....: 48KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3efc1ea28c412e71313324234a069b35619a980a","amp;dn":"She+Wolves+-+England%27s+Early+Queens+++%28BBC+2012+-+Part+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3efc1ea28c412e71313324234a069b35619a980a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,252,30,162,140,65,46,113,49,51,36,35,74,6,155,53,97,154,152,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
