(the capture device was doing these kind of errors!)\n\nThe reason why &quot;Beach Day&quot; &amp; &quot;Carpooling&quot; were VHSRips because \nmy previous capture device broke and I had to wait for another one...Now I\nfinally got it! (carpooling has tracking errors except the 2 don't have any)\n\nAll episodes are recorded on KidsCo Central Europe using a DVB Local Cable\nBox except Recycling Tyres which is a video I downloaded from kidsco's site.\n\nThe &quot;Green Concert&quot; episode is actually &quot;Blue Concert&quot;, they however\nreplaced it with different performers due to Blue being copyrighted artists\nI imagine.\n\nBlue Concert was hard to make cause I had to use the original Romanian video\nand the English audio, and the result came pretty good! (sort of)\n\nhope you enjoy :D\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0049863d80752b29643afec25175e313f781b06b","amp;dn":"Boo+and+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0049863d80752b29643afec25175e313f781b06b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,73,134,61,128,117,43,41,100,58,254,194,81,117,227,19,247,129,176,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
