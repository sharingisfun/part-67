It tells the tale of Death, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and brother to War, the protagonist from the first game wrongfully accused of bringing on a pre-mature apocalypse resulting in the sudden and swift demise of mankind. The game takes place during the same timeline as the first game where Death strives to find proof of his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innocence.\n\nFollow the exploits of Death, horseman of the Apocalypse, in a tale that runs parallel to the events in the original Darksiders game. This epic journey propels Death through the light and dark realms as he strives to redeem his brother War, blamed for inciting Armageddon and the eradication of MankindÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThough the world has been cleansed of life, there are many souls that remain between the realms of Heaven and Hell. In his travels, Death will be joined by long-time companions, and will cross paths with ancient friends and foes alike. Interacting with those you meet on your journey will hold the key to unearthing the secrets behind an insidious plot for Creation itself.. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Note:\n\nAs usual\n\nExtract , Mount or Burn , Install , Play :)\n\n\nPassword for rar : www.blackboxrepack.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8df2a4dfc31c361ca1ebcd9381ffa2d8108dc630","amp;dn":"Darksiders.2.RePacK.Black.Box","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8df2a4dfc31c361ca1ebcd9381ffa2d8108dc630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,242,164,223,195,28,54,28,161,235,205,147,129,255,162,216,16,141,198,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
