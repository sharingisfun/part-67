A totally unique, vibrant, emotional, rhythmic dance music played with  accordions and sung mostly in Creole French patois, but with blues, cajun and early rock &amp; roll influences. The recordings (except last three) were made at taverns and house dances in Houston, Tx. and southwest Louisiana in 1961 &amp; 1962 by Chris Strachwitz. As a nice bonus, both sides of Clifton Chenier's 1954 debut single are included (they're far more R&amp;B-influenced than the field recordings here), and there's a 1949 jump blues-zydeco hybrid by Clarence Garlow, &quot;Bon Ton Roulet.&quot;\n\t\n01.
