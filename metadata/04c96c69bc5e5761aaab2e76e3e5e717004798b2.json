Murrah Federal Building involved far more revealing evidence than the FBI maintains. A Noble Lie presents interviews with police officers, first responders, victims, journalists and investigators whose evidence demonstrates that not all the perpetrators were brought to justice.\n\nAmong the interview subjects are General Benton Partin, former head of weapons development for the Air Force, State Representative Charles Key, members of the Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee and Jesse Trentadue, whose brother Kenneth was tortured and murdered in Federal custody in the days following the bombing.\n\nA Noble Lie: Oklahoma City 1995 is the only full-length documentary that addresses and answers many of the questions people have asked about the bombing. Details as to what really happened regarding this horrific event, taking the lives of 168 people, have been summarily covered up by the Federal Government. A Noble Lie is the culmination of years of research and documentation conducted by independent journalists, scholars, and ordinary citizens. Often risking their personal safety and sanity, they have gathered evidence which threatens to expose the startling reality of what exactly occurred at 9:02 am on April 19, 1995 in Oklahoma City.\n\nUtilizing footage and eyewitness testimony, previously unseen, A Noble Lie will change forever the way you look at the true nature of terrorism.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢120 Minutes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Free Mind Films\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Produced and Directed by James Lane\n\nClick THE LINK BELOW for main master playlist:\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04c96c69bc5e5761aaab2e76e3e5e717004798b2","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+SIN-ister+Secrets+-+79+-+Innocence+Betrayed+and+A+Noble+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04c96c69bc5e5761aaab2e76e3e5e717004798b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,201,108,105,188,94,87,97,170,171,46,118,227,229,231,23,0,71,152,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
