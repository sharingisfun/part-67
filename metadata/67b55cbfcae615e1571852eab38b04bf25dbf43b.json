But they're the same generals we know in name only: their appearance, personality, and gender are all different. One day, first Oda Nobunaga and then all the others are transported to our world. Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67b55cbfcae615e1571852eab38b04bf25dbf43b","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+16+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67b55cbfcae615e1571852eab38b04bf25dbf43b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,181,92,191,202,230,21,225,87,24,82,234,179,139,4,191,37,219,244,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
