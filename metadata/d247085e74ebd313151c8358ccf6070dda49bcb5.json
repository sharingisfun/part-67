I started collecting The Soup episodes back in mid-2010. I wish that I had started earlier. I'm pretty sure that I have every episode that aired from 2009 through 2012 (so far). The Soup took a summer break for a week in 2009 and 2011. So there is no episode for June 26, 2009 and July 15, 2011. There is also no episode for April 29, 2011, thanks to the British Royal Wedding. The soup was broadcast in 4:3 standard definition until September 10, 2010. From then on it was broadcast in 16:9 high definition.\n\nAlmost all episodes from 2008 to 2012-02-15 are scene releases. Episodes after 2012-02-15 were transcoded by me from 720p and x264 scene releases when available. See Sources.txt or Source.xls for information where every episode came from.    \n\nEnjoy the collection!\n\nterpsfan101","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d247085e74ebd313151c8358ccf6070dda49bcb5","amp;dn":"The+Soup+-+2009-2012+%28complete%29%2C+plus+a+few+episodes+from+2008+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d247085e74ebd313151c8358ccf6070dda49bcb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,71,8,94,116,235,211,19,21,28,131,88,204,246,7,13,218,73,188,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
