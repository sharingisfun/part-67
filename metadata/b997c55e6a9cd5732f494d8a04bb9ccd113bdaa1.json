The oratorio was devised as a compliment to the victorious Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland upon his return from the Battle of Culloden (16 April 1746). Other catalogues of Handel's music have referred to the work as HG xxii; and HHA 1/24.\n\nMorell's libretto is based on the deuterocanonical 1 Maccabees (2-8), with motives added from the Antiquitates Judaicae by Flavius Josephus.\n\nThe events depicted in the oratorio are from the period 170-160 BC when Judea was ruled by the Seleucid Empire which undertook to destroy the Jewish religion. Being ordered to worship Zeus, many Jews obeyed under the threat of persecution, however some did not. One who defied was the elderly priest Mattathias who killed a fellow Jew who was about to offer a pagan sacrifice. After tearing down a pagan altar, Mattathias retreated to the hills and gathered others who were willing to fight for their faith.\n\nHandel's music depicts the changing moods of the Jewish people as their fortunes vary from dejection to jubilation.\n\nPart 1\nThe people mourn the death of their leader Mattathias, but his son Simon tries to restore their faith and calls them to arms (Arm, arm, ye brave). Simon's brother (Judas Maccabaeus) assumes the role of leader and inspires the people with thoughts of liberty and victory through the power of Jehovah.\n\nPart 2\nThe people have been victorious, but Judas is concerned that vanity will cause the people to claim victory for themselves. When news arrives that the Seleucid commander Gorgias is preparing to enact revenge, the people's joyous mood gives way to wailing and dejection (Ah! wretched Israel!). Again Judas rallies the people (Sound an alarm) and insists that the pagan altars must be destroyed and that false religions must be resisted.\n\nPart 3\nVictory has finally been achieved for the Jewish people (See, the ConquÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ring Hero Comes!). News arrives that Rome is willing to form an alliance with Judas against the Seleucid empire. The people rejoice that peace has at last come to their country (O lovely peace).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b997c55e6a9cd5732f494d8a04bb9ccd113bdaa1","amp;dn":"H%26auml%3Bndel+-+Judas+Maccabaeus+-+Utah+Symphony+Orchestra%2C+Mauric","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b997c55e6a9cd5732f494d8a04bb9ccd113bdaa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,151,197,94,106,156,213,115,47,73,77,138,4,187,156,205,17,59,218,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
