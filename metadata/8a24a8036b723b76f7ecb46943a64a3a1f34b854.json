As always, please buy after you try.  It's the only right thing to do if you enjoy, and intend on keeping the music you're listening to.\n\nThere's a lot of hip-hop and rap in this bundle, but perhaps none better than &quot;Xist Music Presents.&quot;  I can't remember the last time a finer mixtape was assembled.  Rapper Bumps INF has also dropped his latest &quot;Pain In Paragraphs&quot; album as well.  If you're a southern gospel fan, check out The Booth Brothers tribute to Bill And Gloria Gaither.  How about blues?  Boyd Rivers has a nice little project called &quot;You Can't Make Me Doubt&quot; that is included in this bundle today.  Lead singer of Third Day, Mac Powell, has just released his first ever solo project.  Scripture11 has a nice little self-titled rock album you might enjoy.  And if you like a quieter, more relaxed sounding hymn, be sure to check out &quot;Relaxed Fits&quot; by Roby Duke.\n\nThe 25 titles in this 35th bundle today include...\n\n * Andale - 2012 - Hypocrite - With Joint Heirs\n * Anointed - 2012 - Face To Face - Single\n * Believin Stephen - 2012 - The Preseason\n * Booth Brothers, The - 2012 - A Tribute To The Songs Of Bill And Gloria Gaither\n * Boyd Rivers - 2012 - You Can't Make Me Doubt\n * Bumps INF - 2012 - Pain In Paragraphs\n * Christon Gray - 2012 - Even With Evil With Me\n * David Archuleta - 2012 - Forevermore\n * DJ Cmd - 2012 - Dance 62 - Shout\n * God's Elect - 2012 - Word On The Streetz\n * GS - 2012 - Warning Before Destruction Vol 4\n * Jeremiah - 2012 - Before I Wake\n * Jo Nathan - 2012 - Died In Your Arms - Single\n * Mac Powell - 2012 - Mac Powell\n * MC Jin - 2012 - Crazy Love Ridiculous Faith\n * Novas Effect - 2012 - To Shine Brighter Than Before\n * Rani Arbo And Daisy Mayhem - 2012 - Some Bright Morning\n * ReKnew - 2012 - Ft ReKnew\n * Roby Duke - 2012 - Relaxed Fits\n * Scripture11 - 2012 - Scripture11\n * Sensere - 2012 - The Soul Of Future Worship, Vol 1\n * Seventh Power, The - 2012 - Eternal Power\n * TnT - 2012 - Demolition\n * Various - 2012 - Mercyland Hymns For The Rest Of Us\n * Various - 2012 - Xist Music Presents Move, Vol 1\n * ZG - 2012 - Here Now\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - September 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a24a8036b723b76f7ecb46943a64a3a1f34b854","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+35+of+35%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a24a8036b723b76f7ecb46943a64a3a1f34b854","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,36,168,3,107,114,59,118,247,236,180,105,67,166,74,58,31,52,184,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
