The show revolves around the life of a fictional Gujarati family- the Sarabhai's, who are portrayed as a typical family belonging to the class of elite socialites of Mumbai. They live in a luxurious apartment in the upmarket Cuffe Parade area of South Mumbai. The family consists of Indravardhan Sarabhai and his wife Maya, who live in an apartment with their younger son Rosesh, and their elder son Sahil and his wife Manisha live in the opposite flat. Maya being high class, renames her as Monisha. The middle class habits of Monisha irritate Maya and thus Sarabhai VS Sarabhai. Much of the humour is derived from the artificiality and shallowness in the interactions of the city's elite and their perceived notions of the shortcomings of middle class society.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:923bcf9260f7a30e18a1621f8dc5a534a08f3b26","amp;dn":"Sarabhai+Episodes+1-5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"923bcf9260f7a30e18a1621f8dc5a534a08f3b26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,59,207,146,96,247,163,14,24,161,98,31,141,197,165,52,160,143,59,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
