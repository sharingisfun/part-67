Most of the reels \nwere WLS top 40 for 6 years in a row not missing a week. I found a diferent type of tape (Ampex) and it said GD Huntington and that was it. I of course wanted to transfer it as best could and there were no real 24/48 \nrecorders out there except for computer recording. The computer room was on the complete other side of the home so we did a transfer in real time on a Phillips &quot;super CD&quot; recorder which meant 24/48. What may have happened \nis we ran out of room on a CD and had to stop the recorder very quickly to change CDs and that may also make the missing verse question answered. I started again at the wrong place.this was a huge challenge and I think \nwe did OK.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee847e0c232318b6b1c4a7c14dde6b5154d70c1b","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1978-04-16+-+Huntington+Civic+Ctr+in+Huntington%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee847e0c232318b6b1c4a7c14dde6b5154d70c1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,132,126,12,35,35,24,182,177,196,167,193,77,222,107,81,84,215,12,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
