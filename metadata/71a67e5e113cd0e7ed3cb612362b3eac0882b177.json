Set amidst the latest trends in music, dance and fashion, We the Party is a colorful, cutting-edge comedy set in an ethnically diverse Los Angeles high school during AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first black president. The film focuses on five friends as they deal with romance, money, prom, college, sex, bullies, facebook, fitting in, standing out, and finding themselves. Evoking such classic teen comedies as The Breakfast Club and House Party but with an attitude and style all its own, We the Party captures the hopes, confusion, challenges and dreams of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teenagers as they plunge headlong into an uncertain future. \n\nGenre: Comedy \nIMDB Rating: 3.0/10 \nDirected by: Mario Van Peebles \nStarring: Mario Van Peebles, Snoop Dogg and Michael Jai White \n\nRelease Name: We.the.Party.2012.DVDRip.XviD-N0GRP \nSize: 700 MB \nVideo: XviD, 584 x 296, 793 Kbps \nAudio: English, MP3, 128 Kbps \nRuntime: 1h 24mn\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71a67e5e113cd0e7ed3cb612362b3eac0882b177","amp;dn":"We.the.Party.2012.DVDRip.XviD-N0GRP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71a67e5e113cd0e7ed3cb612362b3eac0882b177","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,166,126,94,17,60,208,231,237,60,182,18,54,43,62,172,8,130,177,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
