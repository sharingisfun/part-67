Cute but geeky Kate (Elaine Hurt) has a crush on Paul (Patrick Delgado), a good looking guy who works at the grocery where her family shops, and when she attends SpaceCon (an event for comic, sci-fi and fantasy fans) with her friends, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pleased to see heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s there as well. Kate is even happier when Paul wants some private time with her, but a kiss gives way to a bite on the neck, and Kate learns that Paul isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pretending to be a vampire like many folks at the Con, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the real thing. Paul became a blood sucker after a run-in with Vince (Devin Bonnee), an angst-y vampire the ladies swoon over, but both Paul and Kate have mixed feelings about being creatures of the night. When KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pal Jason (Santiago Dietche), who carries a torch for her, puts together the pieces and realizes whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happened, he sets out to rescue Kate from the vampires before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late.
