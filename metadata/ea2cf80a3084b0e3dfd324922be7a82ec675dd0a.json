And at the heart of The City is the Carnival of Souls, where both murder and pleasure are offered up for sale. Once in a generation, the carnival hosts a deadly competition that allows every daimon a chance to join the ruling elite. Without the competition, Aya and Kaleb would both face bleak futuresÃ¢â‚¬â€if for different reasons. For each of them, fighting to the death is the only way to try to live.\nAll Mallory knows of The City is that her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â€and every other witch thereÃ¢â‚¬â€fled it for a life in exile in the human world. Instead of a typical teenage life full of friends and maybe even a little romance, Mallory scans quiet streets for threats, hides herself away, and trains to be lethal. She knows it's only a matter of time until a daimon finds her and her father, so she readies herself for the inevitable. While Mallory possesses little knowledge of The City, every inhabitant of The City knows of her. There are plans for Mallory, and soon she, too, will be drawn into the decadence and danger that is the Carnival of Souls.\nFrom Melissa Marr, bestselling author of the Wicked Lovely series and Graveminder, comes a brand-new tale of lush secrets, dark love, and the struggle to forge one's own destiny.\n\n\n                             Format 1 - Epub\n\n                             Format 2 - mobi\n\n\n\n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea2cf80a3084b0e3dfd324922be7a82ec675dd0a","amp;dn":"Carnival+of+Souls+by+Melissa+Marr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea2cf80a3084b0e3dfd324922be7a82ec675dd0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,44,248,10,48,132,176,227,223,211,36,146,43,231,168,46,198,117,221,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
