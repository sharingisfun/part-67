Since it started, this has been my go-to book for fun.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a reasonably simple story, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s well told and is full of wildly creative ideas.  It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make you think too hard, but it sets your imagination racing.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comic book comfort food.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n- The Capeless Crusader \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a few mini-series ending this week, but one that I will definitely miss each month is Smoke and Mirrors. The story of a magician lost in a world where magic really exists has not only been an entertaining story, but a heartfelt one at that.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n- Comics Bastards \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been reading this fantastic story issue-to-issue, then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been missing out on the best show in town.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n- Fanboy Comics\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“IDW has been doing a lot right lately with its new books. Night of 1000 Wolves, The Hypernaturals, ExterminationÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re quietly putting out some of the best comics in the business right now. But even by that standard, Smoke and Mirrors is something genuinely special: a new twist on an old idea.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n- Gamma Squad","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14480fa1898075d0c94fb3b620d3a50b85fbdb1f","amp;dn":"Smoke+and+mirrors+++complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14480fa1898075d0c94fb3b620d3a50b85fbdb1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,72,15,161,137,128,117,208,201,79,179,182,32,211,165,11,133,251,219,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
