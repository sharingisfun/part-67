Now the acclaimed author of Rise of the Vulcans offers a definitive, even-handed account of the messier realities theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve faced in implementing their policies.\n\n In The Obamians, acclaimed author James Mann tells the compelling story of the administrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s struggle to enact a coherent and effective set of policies in a time of global turmoil. At the heart of this struggle are the generational conflicts between the Democratic establishmentÃ¢â‚¬â€including Robert Gates, Hillary Clinton, and Joseph BidenÃ¢â‚¬â€and Obama and his inner circle of largely unknown, remarkably youthful advisers, who came of age after the Cold War had ended.\n\nWritten by a proven master at elucidating political underpinnings even to the politicians themselves, The Obamians is a pivotal reckoning of this historic president and his inner circle, and of how their policies may or may not continue to shape America and the world.\n\n\nJames Mann, &quot;The Obamians: The Struggle Inside the White House to Redefine American Power&quot;\n\nISBN: 0670023760 | 2012 |\n\nEPUB/MOBI | 416 pages | 1 MB/2 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5145298f94e56551de2e0bb9e4bde74f1e5355c0","amp;dn":"The+Struggle+Inside+the+White+House+to+Redefine+American+Power.m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5145298f94e56551de2e0bb9e4bde74f1e5355c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,69,41,143,148,229,101,81,222,46,11,185,228,189,231,79,30,83,85,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
