But in 1995 a lost file from the State Archives turned up, a file that contained the complete interrogations of RasputinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inner circle. With this extensive and explicit amplification of the historical record, Edvard Radzinsky has written a definitive biography, reconstructing in full the fascinating life of an improbable holy man who changed the course of Russian history.\n\nTranslated from the Russian by Judson Rosengrant.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Rasputin-File-Edvard-Radzinsky/dp/0385489102/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346924520&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rasputin+file&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Rasputin-File-Edvard-Radzinsky/dp/0385489102/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346924520&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rasputin+file&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b070e79eabb2c8d55ab5e2b7444084e33bff8415","amp;dn":"The+Rasputin+File+%28EPUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b070e79eabb2c8d55ab5e2b7444084e33bff8415","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,112,231,158,171,178,200,213,90,181,226,183,68,64,132,227,59,255,132,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
