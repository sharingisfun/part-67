Working with official rights to the music and access to Marley's family and friends, Oscar-winning documentarian Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September) creates a thorough account that hits the major points, not stinting on some of the less admirable aspects of Marley's life (including his brood of children fathered with women other than his patient wife, Rita, whose presence indicates just how much she puts Marley's legacy above his personal infidelities). Especially interesting is the sketch of Bob Marley's youth, as a mixed-race--and thus socially ostracized--kid from the village of Nine Mile who began to put together a reggae sound with a group of like-minded musicians in Jamaica in the late '50s and early '60s. That period comes to life, and the account of Marley's ascent, while familiar from such sagas, has its share of offbeat incidents. His death, at age 36 in 1981, does not dominate the movie, but Macdonald does a good job of getting that story laid out. In the meantime, the music and the concert footage are more than enough to justify the movie's existence, and Macdonald makes time to include thoughts about politics, ganja smoking, and Rastafarianism, too. If it's not the final word on Marley, it's an excellent start.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/7903/marleyscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/7903/marleyscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/610/marleyscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/610/marleyscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8999/marleyscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8999/marleyscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/5496/marleyscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/5496/marleyscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/9427/marleyscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/9427/marleyscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/650/marleyscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/650/marleyscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img846.imageshack.us/img846/5859/marleyscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img846.imageshack.us/img846/5859/marleyscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/2087/marleyscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/2087/marleyscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/4569/marleyscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/4569/marleyscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/1962/marleyscreen9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/1962/marleyscreen9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img807.imageshack.us/img807/9624/marleyscreen10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img807.imageshack.us/img807/9624/marleyscreen10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/4050/marleyscreen11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/4050/marleyscreen11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1323 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16.9\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 416\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 145 mins\nFramerate: 29FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.34 GB\nEncoded by: Harry65\nSource: DVD\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/apr/18/marley-review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/apr/18/marley-review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78fe691191636afd52f96c055220736d2bf1160e","amp;dn":"Marley+x264+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78fe691191636afd52f96c055220736d2bf1160e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,254,105,17,145,99,106,253,82,249,108,5,82,32,115,109,43,241,22,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
