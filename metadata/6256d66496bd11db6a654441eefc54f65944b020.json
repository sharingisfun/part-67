Hadley (AgentParsec). It shares the same gameplay elements as the original - you must collect 8 pages while avoiding the enemy. This is not intended to be a copy - simply a way for people who loved Slender to be able to face their fear on a different map with the same awesome gameplay. There are some differences which will make playing a somewhat unique experience - different AI, new sounds, and a different environment.\n\nv1.3 released - fixes the missing textures bug.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6256d66496bd11db6a654441eefc54f65944b020","amp;dn":"Slender+-+Hospice+v1.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6256d66496bd11db6a654441eefc54f65944b020","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,86,214,100,150,189,17,219,106,101,68,65,238,252,84,246,89,68,176,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
