Instead, he gets stuck waiting for a bus in El Fronteras, a sleepy desert town thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so uninviting that Ã¢â‚¬â€œ forget about the ocean Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he can hardly find a glass of water. Then, word of his money spreads to the El Fronteras underworld. Under sudden attack from corrupt cops, gangsters, and desperados, the Man must push back his retirement plans, lock and load, and save sleepy El Fronteras through a dizzying display of spectacular gunfights. \n\nGenre: action \nIMDB rating: 5.0/10 from 384 users \nDirected by: Eduardo Rodriguez \nStarring: Scott Adkins, Yvette Yates and Christian Slater \n\nRelease Name: El.Gringo.2012.DVDRip.XviD-FiCO \nSize: 700 MB \nVideo: XviD,608 x 256, 850 kbit/s \nAudio: English, MP3, 125 kbit/s \nRuntime: 99 min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb1d2c205e873a7315f52f34732ebd023c3d8490","amp;dn":"El+Gringo+2012+DVDRip+XviD-FiCO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb1d2c205e873a7315f52f34732ebd023c3d8490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,29,44,32,94,135,58,115,21,245,47,52,115,46,189,2,60,61,132,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
