The bands repertoire was mainly rock and blues oriented with cover versions of songs from John Mayalls Bluesbreakers, Cream, Jimi Hendrix and Rolling Stones. During 1968/69 Peter Lindhe and Lars Reinau started writing original material to the band and the repertoire started changing from rock/blues cover versions to self composed more lyrical songs with elements of Beatles, Procol Harum and (early)Deep Purple. In 1969 Jrn Anker (Hammond organ) joined the band and he too started contributing new original songs to the band. The Days LP was recorded and in 1971 the band split up. Days is one the the rarest albums from Denmark which also came out on Spectator (Blues Addicts, Terje Jesper &amp; Joachim, Moses). It is full of amazing prog tunes which great organ elements and strong fuzz guitar. A killer album from beginning to end.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90d000238f48a4451226b400a3cfdd02f00cffa8","amp;dn":"Days+-+Days+%281971%2F2008+Denmark+Prog+Rock%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90d000238f48a4451226b400a3cfdd02f00cffa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,208,0,35,143,72,164,69,18,38,180,0,163,207,221,2,240,12,255,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
