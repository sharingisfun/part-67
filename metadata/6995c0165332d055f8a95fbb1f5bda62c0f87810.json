The film is based on the Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris. The live actors provide a sentimental frame story, in which Uncle Remus relates the folk tales of the adventures of Br'er Rabbit and his friends. These anthropomorphic animal characters appear in animation. The hit song from the film was &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot;, which won the 1947 Academy Award for Best Song and is frequently used as part of Disney's montage themes, and which has become widely used in popular culture. The film inspired the Disney theme park attraction Splash Mountain.\n\nThe film has never been released in its entirety on home video in the USA. \nSome portions of this film have been issued on VHS and DVD as part of either compilations or special editions of Disney films.\n\n\nCast:\n\n    James Baskett as Uncle Remus\n    Bobby Driscoll as Johnny\n    Luana Patten as Ginny Favers\n    Glenn Leedy as Toby\n    Ruth Warrick as Sally\n    Lucile Watson as Grandmother\n    Hattie McDaniel as Aunt Tempy\n    Erik Rolf as John\n    Olivier Urbain as Mr. Favers\n    Mary Field as Mrs. Favers\n    Anita Brown as Maid\n    George Nokes as Jake Favers\n    Gene Holland as Joe Favers\n\nVoices:\n\n    Johnny Lee as Br'er Rabbit\n    James Baskett as Br'er Fox\n    Nick Stewart as Br'er Bear\n    Roy Glenn as Br'er Frog\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n~~~Rest in Peace, James Baskett~~~ \n(February 16, 1904 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ July 9, 1948)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6995c0165332d055f8a95fbb1f5bda62c0f87810","amp;dn":"Song+of+the+South+%5BiTunes+%2F+iPad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6995c0165332d055f8a95fbb1f5bda62c0f87810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,149,192,22,83,50,208,85,248,169,95,187,31,91,218,98,192,248,120,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
