Dont ask me how cause i still dont know really how, but it was from a very strange page where they ask you to do some crazy tests and then you receive results on your provided cell phone, bla,bla,bla.....\nI didnt really provided my number and still was able to download the complete Digidesign folder which had PT9Loader 2.0 (Beta) inside!\n\nI had troubles making bounces on ProTools 9. Was causing me all the time CPU Overloads, and simply coudnt do it which was a pain in #$% specially considering its a Music Software.\n\nWell, i didnt knew exactly what to do with the files so, before replacing all Digidesign Folder by the new one i got, i decided to give a try only with the PT9Loader 2.0 (Beta).\n\nBackuped the original PtLoader and then replaced it with the new version 2.0.\n\nTried to run ProTools and made a small test about bouncing. Didnt worked at the first time, 2nd time, or even the 3rd time. But, with all this troubles i found a solution for this problem.\nIf you disable your Internet connection, Wireless or Ethernet, and then make the bounce, it works! Not 100% of the times, but around 85%. If it doesnt work the first time, just try it again.\nI also have from time to time the Ilock issue, but you just re run the program and it should be gone.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPT9Loader 2.0 (Beta) didnt really solved the bounce problem but i have a feeling that its quicker opening ProTools 9 and for what i read about it, its a more stable version that removes some bugs, i just dont know which ones but, if it makes it more stable then i want it! :D\n\nI decided to post anyway the file cause i know there are folks desperate to find it like i was and...i took the chance to share a workaround for the bouncing problem!\n\nInstructions as i made:\n\n1. Backup your Ptloader.app\n2. Copy PT9Loader 2.0 (Beta) to protools folder (replacing the already backuped loader)\n3. Drag the new PT9Loader 2.0 to your dock\n4. Run your Protools 9 (Obviously from the new loader 2.0)\n5. When about to make bounce, disable Internet connection, wireless or Ethernet. In my case i had ethernet and i just unplugged the cable\n\nThats it guys!\n\n\n\n*Guys, make all of this on your own responsability. Im just sharing a file and the experience i had with it. So dont come here complaining if it doesnt work with you. Thanks and enjoy!\n\nPeace....\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9951923108d916f71146d3c45da29c46756799be","amp;dn":"PT9Loader+2.0%28beta%29.app.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9951923108d916f71146d3c45da29c46756799be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,81,146,49,8,217,22,247,17,70,211,196,93,162,156,70,117,103,153,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
