Commercial DVD titles are often encrypted, which prevents you from either copying them to your hard drive, or if you manage to do so, being able to play the resulting files. DVDShrink overcomes this problem with built-in decryption algorithms.\n\nThe next problem is not so easy. Most DVD video titles are simply too large to fit, without modification, onto a single recordable DVD-R disk. DVDShrink overcomes this problem by compressing or &quot;shrinking&quot; the data from your original DVD.\n\nDVDShrink also allows you to re-author your DVD. You can make your own compilation from one or more source DVDs, or select only the parts of a DVD which you intend to view, thus preserving more space on your backup for the highest quality viewing.\n\nLast but not least, why use DVD Shrink? Because DVDShrink is free!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f891b48b2fa483c3eeb5c77f440272ec5db9293d","amp;dn":"dvdshrink32setup.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f891b48b2fa483c3eeb5c77f440272ec5db9293d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,145,180,139,47,164,131,195,238,181,199,127,68,2,114,236,93,185,41,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
