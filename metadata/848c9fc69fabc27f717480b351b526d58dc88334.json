Archduke Franz Ferd ina nd, heir to the Austro-Hungarianthrone,climbed into an open-topped car with his wife for a ride throug h Sarajevo, the capital town of Bosnia-Herzegovina. He had no inkling of what lay in store for hi m. This was to be a momentous ride for ma nki nd, and his last. He was on the road to the g reatest conflict the world had seen till that time - World War I. Nineteen year old Gavrilo Princip, shot and killed both Franz Ferdinand and his wife. The automatic pistol of that young Serbian not only put an end to the l ife of a noble and his wife, but also triggered a great war, that claimed more than ten million lives.\nThe war to end all wars actually became a curtain raiser for a more deadly war - World War II . It has been estimated that more than sixty million people died in that war. This issue of Manorama Tell Me Why sketches World War I and World War II, two of  the darkest chapters in the history of mankind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:848c9fc69fabc27f717480b351b526d58dc88334","amp;dn":"World+Wars+%28Tell+Me+Why+%2354%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"848c9fc69fabc27f717480b351b526d58dc88334","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,140,159,198,159,171,194,127,113,116,128,179,81,181,38,213,141,200,131,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
