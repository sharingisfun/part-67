I couldn't believe this when it was first rumoured, and when it turned out true I vowed to do my best to fix it.\n\n\nWhat is it?\nIt's an interception d3d9.dll that you place in the same folder as the game executable. It intercepts the game's calls to the DirectX 9 API and changes them as necessary to enable a higher internal rendering resolution.\n\n\nHow do I use it?\nPlace d3d9.dll and DSfix.ini into the game's binary directory. (The place where DARKSOULS.exe is)\nYou can open DSfix.ini with a text editor to adjust the desired internal resolution.\n\n\nWill it work?\nSo far, this has only been tested on my computer, on the first half hour or so of the game. I can not and will not guarantee that it will work for anyone else, or not have any adverse effect on your game/computer. Use at your own risk! If you encounter any issues that seem like they could be caused by DSfix, let me know.\n\n\nWhy is it still blurry?\nI don't know at this point in time. It's already clear that there is a lot more detail and less aliasing using an increased framebuffer resolution -- as you would expect! -- but there is some residual blur. I'm trying to work out if this is due to my method or something inherent in the game. I will certainly continue working on this.\n\n\nWill it cause performance problems?\nThat depends on your system configuration. Usually, performance scales rather linearly with framebuffer size, and so far this game does not seem different. My 660 maintained a locked 30 FPS throughout ~ 1/2 hour of testing in the starting area of the game at 2560x1440.&quot;\n\n   -- Compliments of Durante @ http://www.neogaf.com/forum/member.php?u=14988","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0ea89e82b21bf1236bc530908e7353477fa88f9","amp;dn":"Dark+Souls+Prepare+to+Die+Edition+internal+rendering+resolution+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0ea89e82b21bf1236bc530908e7353477fa88f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,234,137,232,43,33,191,18,54,188,83,9,8,231,53,52,119,250,136,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
