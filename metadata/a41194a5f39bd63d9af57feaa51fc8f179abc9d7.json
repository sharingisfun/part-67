Formerly she was writer for the humorous fake news site The Onion, as well as Heeb Magazine, a hub for all things Jewish and funny. More recently she was a finalist on season 7 of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Last Comic Standing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Her Comedy Central special premiered in March of this year. On top of performing at various comedy festivals, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appeared on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Comics UnleashedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just For LaughsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comedy series on TBS.\n\nFeinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album Thug Tears (released in conjunction with Comedy Central Records) is one of the funniest IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had a chance to review since writing for AmericasComedy. Feinstein expertly sets up incredibly awkward and hilarious social situations, and with spot on narration, has her audience rolling. Right away you know nothing is off limits when Feinstein creates a visual of her mother critiquing her dirty talk while Feinstein is getting laid.\n\nIn combination with great story-telling skills, Feinstein incorporates a surprising range of voices and characters. From her whorish friends, to a gangster named Trey, you never know whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to transform into next.\n\n\n01 - Sprinkled with gay\n02 - Talking dirty\n03 - My unstoppable whore friends\n04 - Puerto Rican confidence\n05 - Soft fears\n06 - Navajo graveyard\n07 - My mom at emcee battles\n08 - Thug tears\n09 - My cheap dad (sorry, dad)\n10 - Broads in the '40s\n11 - Humping game\n12 - Fairytales and porn\n13 - Titty fun\n14 - My grandma and the booty clap\n15 - Vegas douchery\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a41194a5f39bd63d9af57feaa51fc8f179abc9d7","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Rachel+Feinstein+-+Thug+Tears","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a41194a5f39bd63d9af57feaa51fc8f179abc9d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,17,148,165,243,155,214,61,154,245,127,234,165,31,200,241,121,171,201,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
