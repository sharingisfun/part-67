After the program's regular uninstaller runs, you can remove additional unnecessary files, folders and registry keys that are usually left over on your computer. Even if you have a broken installation, Revo Uninstaller Pro scans for an application's data on your hard disk drives and in the Windows registry and shows all found files, folders and registry keys so you can delete them.\n\nWith its unique &quot;Hunter mode&quot;, Revo Uninstaller Pro offers you some simple, easy to use, but effective and powerful methods for uninstalling software. You can use it to manage your installed and/or running software programs.\n\nRevo Uninstaller Pro has a very powerful feature called Forced Uninstall. This feature allows you to remove leftovers of programs that are already uninstalled, incomplete installations and uninstallations of programs! It does not matter if the program, you want to remove, is not listed in Revo Uninstaller Pro or in Windows Add/Remove Programs Control Panel applet. Forced Uninstall gives the power to the user but steel keeps the safety and the accuracy of the results.\n\nRevo Uninstaller Pro has another feature that allows monitoring of installation of a program and detects system changes during that installation. The process is done in real time Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€œ simultaneously! This feature is also very powerful because by monitoring system changes during the installation we eliminate all the scanning algorithms when we need to uninstall that program. \n\n\nCompatible with: Windows XP, 2003, Vista and Win7 (32/64-bit)\nMultilingual: English, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Deustch, Dutch, Danish, Bulgarian, Polish, Slovak, Hebrew, Macedonian.\n\n\n                                  By bobiras2009\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:843bc199adf492121914db829c9c1c6cfa29e3a3","amp;dn":"Revo+Uninstaller+Pro+v2.5.8+Final+%2832%2F64-bit%29+Full+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"843bc199adf492121914db829c9c1c6cfa29e3a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,59,193,153,173,244,146,18,25,20,219,130,156,156,28,108,250,41,227,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
