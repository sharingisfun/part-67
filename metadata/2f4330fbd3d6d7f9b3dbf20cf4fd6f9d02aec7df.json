Taking people's identities and shapeshifting into them has become more tactical. Due to Blackwatch's actions in the Yellow Zone, if the player assumes the role of a soldier, people will react to him in a way that they show they want nothing to do with him. To make sure that enemies do not overwhelm the player, Radical has created a dodging system and new, more realistic AI. Heller will be able to use weapons in the game, such as ripping the cannon off a tank and using it against enemies. Heller can also sneak up on unsuspecting human enemies, inject the Blacklight virus in them and create a &quot;BioBomb&quot; out of them to blow up objects, enemies and such. Heller also has improved strength, movement, invulnerability (self-healing and endurance), and has a sonar sense. The sonar includes a new pulse ability that highlights the key features of an environment to make it easier for the player to find someone, instead of looking in a large crowd for a person with an icon above their head. Radical has stated that the powers will be more meaningful, appearing as mutations and upgrades that let players decide how they want to play as Heller.\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f4330fbd3d6d7f9b3dbf20cf4fd6f9d02aec7df","amp;dn":"PROTOTYPE+2+-+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f4330fbd3d6d7f9b3dbf20cf4fd6f9d02aec7df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,67,48,251,211,214,215,249,179,219,242,12,244,253,111,157,2,174,199,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
