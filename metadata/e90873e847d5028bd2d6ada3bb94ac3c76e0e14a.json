What was unprecedented, however, was not simply the warÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scale, but its causes. Unlike previous territorial or political clashes, the war launched by Nazi Germany was an ideological one, waged to wipe entire peoples and cultures from the face of the earth.\n\nIn Nazism and War, Richard Bessel, one of the preeminent authorities on the social and political history of modern Germany, demonstrates how racial hatred was the driving force behindÃ¢â‚¬â€œand not a by-product ofÃ¢â‚¬â€œNazism. War was the anvil on which HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worldview was forged; to him, war was Ã¢â‚¬Å“the most memorable period of my life,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“all the past fell away into oblivion.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ German National Socialism was born in war, emerging triumphant over a country deeply scarred by defeat and eager to reclaim its greatness and to punish those who had usurped it. As a political philosophy, Nazism glorified struggle and conflict, viewing them as the purpose of a nation and a measure of its overall condition. As a political movement and state system, Nazism made its ideology real, plunging the European continent into a war of annihilation and a sea of blood. NazismÃ¢â‚¬â€œinseparable from warÃ¢â‚¬â€œdestroyed the old Europe, and thus helped to create the world in which we live.\n\nIncisive, authoritative, and immensely readable, this is an incendiary and forcefully argued work of scholarship that will rank with the most influential historical analyses of our time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e90873e847d5028bd2d6ada3bb94ac3c76e0e14a","amp;dn":"Nazism+and+War+-+Richard+Bessel+%5B128%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e90873e847d5028bd2d6ada3bb94ac3c76e0e14a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,8,115,232,71,213,2,139,210,214,173,163,187,148,172,60,118,224,225,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
