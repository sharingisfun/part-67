It featured a production team led by director ShinichirÃ…ï¿½ Watanabe, screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, mechanical designer Kimitoshi Yamane and composer Yoko Kanno. The twenty-six episodes (&quot;sessions&quot;) of the series comprise a complete storyline set in the year 2071. It follows the adventures, misadventures and tragedies of a bounty hunter (&quot;cowboy&quot;) crew travelling on the Bebop, their spaceship. Cowboy Bebop also explores several philosophical concepts including existentialism, loneliness, and existential ennui.\n\nStory\n\nThe 26-episode series revolves around the often violent adventures undertaken by the arguably mismatched crew of the BeBop starship. The crew is made up of four unique characters: Jet Black, a former ISSP police officer who retired following a mob hit that cost him his arm, Spike Spiegel, a laid-back exiled hitman of the ruthless Red Dragons' Syndicate, Faye Valentine, a beautiful amnesiac con artist who awakened into the future world after a lengthy period of cryogenic hibernation, and Radical Edward, a hyperactive and barefooted preteen girl with a reputation as a prolific computer hacker. They are also accompanied by Ein, a hyperintelligent, genetically-engineered stray Corgi hound.\n\nBy a strange twist of their respective fates, this foursome ends up partnering together, using their unique talents to become a ragtag team of bounty hunters, although their fortunes as such are at best mixed.\n\nThroughout the series, Bebop crew members' pasts catch up with them, and the show regularly utilizes flashbacks to illustrate the history of the main characters. The day-to-day life of the crew is also explored throughout the series.\n\n\nDual Audio (Japanese/English)\nSub : English\nFile Format : MKV 640X480","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9df3a237885a2e4ec9bb37717b26bec38d8963e","amp;dn":"COWBOY+BEBOP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9df3a237885a2e4ec9bb37717b26bec38d8963e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,223,58,35,120,133,162,228,236,155,179,119,23,178,107,236,56,216,150,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
