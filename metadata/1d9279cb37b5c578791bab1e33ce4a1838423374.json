Their swing and jazz-influenced highlife is very 'Chugga Chugga' ~The Beat (USA)\n\nAlthough it's imperfect, Golden Highlife Classics is a good collection of King Bruce &amp; the Blackbeats' classic recordings from the '50s and '60s. Since there are so few CD-era compilations of his material available, this is the introduction by default, but it's not a bad one, since it does capture the essence of the group's infectious dance sound.~Stephen Thomas Erlewine (Allmusic)\n\n'Bruce formed the BBs in 1952, fronting a guitar/bass/drums combo with a luxurious spread of horns that now have all the acoustic properties of a Thirties 78, a vintage crispness that's no bad thing when you're whirling around to such quaint confections today'~Q Magazine\n\n01.
