How do you find it among the thousands of designs on your computer? Using StitchBuddyÃŠÂ¼s plugins, itÃŠÂ¼s easy to find all matching files with Spotlight. Use Quick Look to inspect them, then open the ones you want to use.\n\nMaybe the design needs a little tweaking before you can use it. StitchBuddy can help! Change colors, rearrange parts, or delete them. Is the design in the wrong format? No problem, simply save it in the one you need. Print an actual size template for easy placement of the fabric in your hoop. Janome users can even export the design directly to their USB or CompactFlash card connected to their computer.\n\n\nWhat's New\nVersion 2.4.2\n\n* Application and plugins code signed to comply with Gatekeeper of OS X 10.8 &quot;Mountain Lion&quot;\n\nRequirements\nIntel, Mac OS X 10.5 or later ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c86f7b417af34dcc99af1d67d6292cdbc73e5d06","amp;dn":"StitchBuddy+2.4.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c86f7b417af34dcc99af1d67d6292cdbc73e5d06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,111,123,65,122,243,77,204,153,175,29,103,214,41,44,219,199,62,93,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
