Dr. John Tweedie of &quot;Christians For Israel&quot; as he shows you Israel and the Jewish people as you may never have seen them before. Discover how God's ancient promise to Abraham has - and is - being fulfilled against all odds.\n\nOur world has been forever changed by one nation, a Jewish nation God called Israel. It all began when God spoke to Abraham, the first Hebrew, and promised that he and his descendants would bless the world. From that moment onward, until now, the Jewish people, Abraham's descendants, have flooded the world with the knowledge of God even as they reflected Heaven's light.\n\nThe new six unit series examines how Israel has influenced the world and fulfilled her God-appointed mandate by becoming &quot;a light to the nations.&quot;  Specifically, the series focuses on God's promise to bless the nations through Abraham's descendants. Among other things, the series examines how Jewish adherence to Torah teachings and traditions has influenced international standards of ethics, morality and family life.  The series also illustrates how Jewish ingenuity and innovation in the 20th and 21st centuries have contributed to the well-being of humanity as a whole.\n\n&quot;I've been to Israel fifteen times now, and love that land more with each visit.  Even more, I'm devoted to Israel because God claims that land as 'The apple of His eye.'   Viewing Israel, A Journey of Light is like visiting that Holy Land in person.  In fact -- it's better, because no tour guide I've known can furnish the kind of information, insight and pictorial beauty of this series.  I recommend it for everyone who loves Israel and our God.&quot;  -- Mr. Pat Boone\n\nUnits in the series include:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Let There Be Light\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A Jewish Hope\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Scattered Light\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Nearly Extinguished\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A Light to the Nations\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The Fight to be Light\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: \n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:318ddce799121fe1397b3f98e4bb3eaabaefefb1","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Prophetic+Times+-+87+-+Israel+A+Journey+of+Light+-+Light","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"318ddce799121fe1397b3f98e4bb3eaabaefefb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,141,220,231,153,18,31,225,57,123,63,152,228,187,62,170,186,239,239,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
