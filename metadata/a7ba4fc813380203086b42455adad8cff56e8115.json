I searched the great TPB site for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alpha FlightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comics, but could only locate a few copies of Volume 4.\n\nSo, after a bit more research, I found what I was looking for, and more.  I have since compiled my findings into five separate torrents, named thusly:  Alpha Flight Volume 1; Alpha Flight Volume 2; Alpha Flight Volume 3; Alpha Flight Volume 4 and Alpha Flight Miscellaneous.  All of these torrents are presented here, for your downloading/reading pleasures.\n\nAlpha Flight Volume 1 (1983) consists of ALL 130 Alpha Flight issues, plus the two Annuals, 1986 and 1987.  \n\nAlpha Flight Volume 2 (1997) consists of ALL 21 AF issues, plus the 1998 Annual.  \n\nAlpha Flight Volume 3 (2004) consists of ALL 12 AF issues.  \n\nAlpha Flight Volume 4 (2011) consists of ALL nine issues.  \n\nAlpha Flight Miscellaneous contains:  Alpha Flight Classic 1 (a compilation of AF Volume 1, 1-8;) Alpha Flight Classic 2 (a compilation of AF Volume 1, 9-19 + X-Men 109;) ALL five issues of Omega Flight (which was part of the The Initiative saga; and finally, an issue of, What IfÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ entitled, What IfÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Wolverine Led Alpha Flight.\n\nAlpha Flight is a fictional superhero team published by Marvel Comics, noteworthy for being one of the few Canadian superhero teams.  Created by the great John Byrne, the team first appeared in Uncanny X-Men 120, in April of 1979.\n\nAlpha Flight is noted for being Canada's answer to the Avengers.  Most team members have distinctly Canadian attributes, such as Inuit, or First Nations heritage.  Throughout most of its history, the team has worked for Department H, a fictional branch of CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Department of National Defence that deals with super-powered villains.\n\nThe rest of the story can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Flight&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Flight&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n\nNOTE:  These scans are NOT my own.
