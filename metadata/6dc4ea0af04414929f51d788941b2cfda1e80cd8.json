Apple products, indie music, food co-ops, and vintage T-shirts make them weak in the knees. \n\nThey believe theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re unique, yet somehow theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all exactly the same, talking about how they Ã¢â‚¬Å“getÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sarah SilvermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“subversiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comedy and Wes AndersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“drollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ films. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also down with diversity and up on all the best microbrews, breakfast spots, foreign cinema, and authentic sushi. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re organic, ironic, and do not own TVs. \n\nYou know who they are: TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re white people. And theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re here, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re gonna have to deal. Fortunately, hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a book that investigates, explains, and offers advice for finding social success with the Caucasian persuasion. So kick back on your IKEA couch and lose yourself in the ultimate guide to the unbearable whiteness of being.\n\nPraise for STUFF WHITE PEOPLE LIKE: \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The best of a hilarious Web site: an uncannily accurate catalog of dead-on predilections. The Criterion Collection of classic films? Haircuts with bangs? Expensive fruit juice? Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlonde on BlondeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on the iPod? The author knows who reads The New Yorker and who wears plaid.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œJanet MaslinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s summer picks, CBS.com\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The author of &quot;Stuff White People Like&quot; skewers the sacred cows of lefty Caucasian culture, from the Prius to David Sedaris. . . . It gently mocks the habits and pretensions of urbane, educated, left-leaning whites, skewering their passion for Barack Obama and public transportation (as long as it's not a bus), their idle threats to move to Canada, and joy in playing children's games as adults. Kickball, anyone?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œSalon.com\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A handy reference guide with which you can check just how white you are. Hint: If you like only documentaries and think your child is gifted, you glow in the dark, buddy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œNY Daily News ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dc4ea0af04414929f51d788941b2cfda1e80cd8","amp;dn":"Stuff+White+People+Like","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dc4ea0af04414929f51d788941b2cfda1e80cd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,196,234,10,240,68,20,146,159,81,215,136,148,27,44,253,161,232,12,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
