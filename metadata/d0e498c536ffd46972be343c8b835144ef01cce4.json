Windows is the largest operating system on desktops and servers worldwide, which mean more intrusions, malware infections, and cybercrime happen on these systems. Windows Forensic Analysis DVD Toolkit, 2E covers both live and post-mortem response collection and analysis methodologies, addressing material that is applicable to law enforcement, the federal government, students, and consultants. The book is also accessible to system administrators, who are often the frontline when an incident occurs, but due to staffing and budget constraints do not have the necessary knowledge to respond effectively.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0e498c536ffd46972be343c8b835144ef01cce4","amp;dn":"Windows+Forensic+Analysis+DVD+Toolkit%2C+Second+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0e498c536ffd46972be343c8b835144ef01cce4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,228,152,197,54,255,212,105,114,190,52,60,139,131,81,68,239,1,204,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
