This Helped me a TON since I own a dual core processor. Before I used this Blitzkrieg game wouldn't start most of the time and when it did I had sound issues and graphic issues. \n\n\n It works with any game that uses the blitzkrieg engine (blitzkrieg,burning horizon,stalingrad cuban missile crisis aftermath and ice crusade,talvisota,and burning horizon 2)...\n\n\n Do not use on blitzkrieg 2 and its add-ons. Its a very small file and and very easy to use. After it is installed, you open the program and find the file &quot;game.exe&quot; and hit ok...\n\n  HIGHLY recommended!!!!!
