Lydia makes the drop while Bill waits to follow whoever picks up the envelope--only neither one anticipated that Lydia would be shot at and that the money would disappear in the ensuing confusion. Thus begins an extremely convoluted and fast-paced plot that takes Lydia and Bill from Chinatown sweatshops to very &quot;in&quot; clubs frequented by models and drug dealers. Along the way, Lydia struggles with her brothers' habit of treating her as the &quot;little sister&quot; to be protected, her mother's repeated attempts at matchmaking, and her own feelings about Bill and where their relationship is headed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8605fb34258cce5dd469ba774f4f3aacfa5d2f00","amp;dn":"S.J.+Rozan+-+Mandarin+Plaid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8605fb34258cce5dd469ba774f4f3aacfa5d2f00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,5,251,52,37,140,206,93,212,105,186,119,79,79,58,172,250,93,47,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
