But most Americans, watching comfortably on their TVs and computers, witness mostly to statistics, stump speeches, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“expertÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rhetoric, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really going on there. Bill talks to Karl Marlantes Ã¢â‚¬â€ a highly-decorated Vietnam veteran, Rhodes Scholar, author, and PTSD survivor Ã¢â‚¬â€ about what we on the insulated outside need to understand about the minds and hearts of our modern warriors. Marlantes shares with Bill intimate stories about how his battlefield experiences both shaped and nearly destroyed him, even after returning to civilian life.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Thou shalt not killÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a tenet you just do not violate, and so all your young life, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drilled into your head. And then suddenly, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re 18 or 19 and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re saying, Ã¢â‚¬ËœGo get Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem and kill for your country.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ And then you come back and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWell, thou shalt not killÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ again. Believe me, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a difficult thing to deal with,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Marlantes tells Bill. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You take a young man and put him in the role of God, where he is asked to take a life Ã¢â‚¬â€ thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something no 19-year-old is able to handle.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f5a94441bbe53085e8c9ce4a991528be544e76a","amp;dn":"What+It%26rsquo%3Bs+Like+to+Go+to+War-+PBS-Moyers+%26amp%3B+Company-avi-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f5a94441bbe53085e8c9ce4a991528be544e76a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,90,148,68,27,190,83,8,94,140,156,228,169,145,82,139,229,68,231,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
