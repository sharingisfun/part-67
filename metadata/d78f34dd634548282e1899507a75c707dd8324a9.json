With them gone, it seems that even the Marvel Universe has gone quiet.  All thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left is to pick up the pieces.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed!\n\nNOTE:  These are not my scans.  All praise and glory to the original scanners, please.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d78f34dd634548282e1899507a75c707dd8324a9","amp;dn":"Tales+Of+The+Marvel+Universe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d78f34dd634548282e1899507a75c707dd8324a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,143,52,221,99,69,72,40,46,24,153,80,122,117,199,7,221,131,36,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
