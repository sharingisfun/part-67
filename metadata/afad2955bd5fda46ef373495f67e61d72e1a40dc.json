On a special Labor Day, DNC-eve edition of The Ed Show, Ed Schultz not only answer that question, he will end the debate with a history lesson for Republicans with Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D- MD).\n\nThen, right-wing talkers continue their assault on Sandra Fluke (attorney and WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rights Activist). &quot;I'm just wondering when Sandra Fluke speaks, what they're going to drop on her at the convention,&quot; Bill O'Reilly said last week on Fox News. Fluke herself joins Ed to look at the ongoing war on women and preview her DNC speech.\n\nMitt Romney's RNC speech did little to shift the polls in his favor.  Ed asked Karen Finney (MSNBC Political Analyst and Former DNC Communications Director), what it means for the GOP ticket.\n\nPresident Obama rallied the troops Monday and he has a good record with labor, but does he need to do more to get over the finish line?  Ed asked  James Hoffa (President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters), and Larry Cohen (President of the Communications Workers of America).\n\nPaul Ryan's marathon of lying now includes lying aboutÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a marathon.  Ed expained how the vice presidential nominee is running a losing race against the truth.\n\nWhat do the Democrats need to accomplish in Charlotte?  Ed asked Gov. Brian Schweitzer (D-MT) in the Big Finish!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afad2955bd5fda46ef373495f67e61d72e1a40dc","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+9-3-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afad2955bd5fda46ef373495f67e61d72e1a40dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,173,41,85,189,95,218,70,239,55,52,149,246,126,97,215,46,26,64,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
