Joe Biden told a largely black audience that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to return them\n to Ã¢â‚¬Å“chains.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Can you imagine if a Republican made a comment like that about    DemocratsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n Australia wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t allow cigarette packages to display anything, but horrific cancer pictures. \n Even rugged Australia is losing its libertiesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Adam Carolla stops by for a visit.\n\n\nPrager 20120815     2 Male/Female Hour: Career First?\n\nPrager H2.. Many women, especially the well-educated, have been persuaded that what they really want is a career..\n marriage and family is secondary. But is that true to female nature? And what price is paid?\n\n\nPrager 20120815     1 Hollywood Leaves Hollywood\n\nPrager H1.. There is no community more liberal than Hollywood. IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it odd then that the studios will do \n almost anything to avoid CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high taxes and union work rules? \n These are the same studio executives and high-paid actors who support high taxes and unions at the ballot box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Download, seed, and spread the word.
