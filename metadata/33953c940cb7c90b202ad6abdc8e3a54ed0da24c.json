Sinister figures like the dean Professor Maltravers (Charles Dance), spoilt and scheming Dorian (Christian Cooke) and snobbish sex-bomb Rosalind (Isabella Calthorpe) routinely stalk it's pristine corridors. The university, in an attempt to modernise, has thrown it's doors open to accommodate students from &quot;the lower classes&quot;. This means characters like streetwise Theo Mackenzie (Reggie Yates), dotty Welsh girl Maddy (Elen Rhys) and village idiots Angus and Raj (Mark Wood and Arnab Chanda) can enter into the fray.\n\nHowever, as someone succinctly puts it, &quot;this college is rotten - from the bottom to the very top&quot; and Maltravers and Dorian are anxious to protect the secrets of the mysterious Dandelion Club before all hell breaks loose in the college...\n\nA suspenseful and generallly well-acted series so far, only failing in the poorly scriptly comedy segments, which are badly written and feature an excess of nudity.\n\nThat aside, this is still good quality drama.\n\nIMDB &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1283456/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1283456/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWiki &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(TV_series)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nList of Episodes &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Trinity_episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Trinity_episodes&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33953c940cb7c90b202ad6abdc8e3a54ed0da24c","amp;dn":"Trinity+S01+%28Xvid%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33953c940cb7c90b202ad6abdc8e3a54ed0da24c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,149,60,148,12,183,201,11,32,42,214,171,220,142,58,84,237,13,162,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
