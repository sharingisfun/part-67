Recognized as one the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading scholars of U.S. Middle East policy and of strategic nonviolent action, He serves as a senior policy analyst for the Foreign Policy in Focus project of the Institute for Policy Studies, an associate editor of Peace Review, a contributing editor of Tikkun, and chair of the academic advisory committee for the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict. He is on to discuss how the California State Assembly Seeks to Stifle Debate on Israel.\n\n\n&quot;The Other&quot; Scott Horton will be on to talk about the DOJ dropping their investigation into CIA torture deaths. \n\nJournalist Gareth Porter will be on to talk about the latest IAEA Iran report.\n\n\nThe first 35 minutes or so of today's show was plagued by audio problems, or network problems... certainly problems. That all cleared up shortly after the start of the Zunes interview, and things were fine through to the end. In spite of the technical issues, this was a great show. Scott's interview with The Other Scott Horton (from Harpers) is a piece you may want to listen to more than once. It comprises part &quot;c&quot; of the upload.\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c4d6404aceb33762e0358e1ec62bacbfddf753a","amp;dn":"Scott+Horton+Show+-+2012+Sep+03+MO+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c4d6404aceb33762e0358e1ec62bacbfddf753a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,77,100,4,172,235,51,118,46,3,88,225,236,98,186,203,253,223,117,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
