As well as files for Mission Barbarossa. I made a custom file for Mission Barbarossa and Mission Kursk, the add0ons for Blitzkrieg made by the developers of Blitzkrieg. I liked the format of the Original Blitzkrieg. Barbarossa and Kursk are MUCH harder. So I made a custom file to make them play more like the Original Blitzkrieg. If anyone feels like me and likes the original gameplay let me know and I will upload Barbarossa and Kursk with my mod already installed in the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d4ff970334dcc719691ebe8c15e6d60d7fc0502","amp;dn":"Blitzkrieg+Major+mods%2C+maps%2C+and+Mission+Barbarossa+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d4ff970334dcc719691ebe8c15e6d60d7fc0502","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,79,249,112,51,77,204,113,150,145,235,232,193,94,109,96,215,252,5,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
