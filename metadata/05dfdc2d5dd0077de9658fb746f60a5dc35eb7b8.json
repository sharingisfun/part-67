So it is always up-to-date with the newest and/or best components.\n    All components have been carefully selected for specific purposes. It is not just a random bunch of stuff thrown together.\n    It is very user-friendly and easy to use.\n    The installation is fully customizable, meaning that you are able to install just those components that you really want.\n    The customization abilities even go beyond the component level. Some components are able to handle multiple formats. You can specify exactly which components should handle which formats. The pack can thus be fully tweaked to your own specific needs and preferences.\n    Uninstallation removes everything that was installed by the pack. Including all registry keys.\n    It is extremely easy to make a fully customized unattended installation with the integrated wizard.\n    It does not contain any bad, buggy or unstable codecs.\n\n\n                                  By bobiras2009\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05dfdc2d5dd0077de9658fb746f60a5dc35eb7b8","amp;dn":"K-Lite+Mega+Codec+Pack+9.20+Final+%5BWindows%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05dfdc2d5dd0077de9658fb746f60a5dc35eb7b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,223,220,45,93,208,7,125,233,101,143,183,70,246,10,93,195,94,183,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
