It was made as a Telugu film in 1960. Many actors and companies have staged this production throughout Andhra Pradesh, India, and abroad.\n\n\nThe plot is based on the story of Mahabharata, an ancient Sanskrit epic. Krishna acts as an emissary between Pandavas and Kauravas to prevent a war. The play opens with the DvÃ„ï¿½rakÃ„ï¿½ scene, when Krishna is having a nap at his palace. Duryodhana and Arjuna arrive to seek his help in the impending war. Krishna puts himself on one side and his entire army on the other and asks Arjuna to choose first. He promises not to participate in the war himself. Arjuna responds by seeking Krishna's presence in the war as his charioteer. Duryodhana happily gets Krishna's army on his side.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78d8a8dd0f8b2163f6482f2407f166a701bd7a76","amp;dn":"Sri+Krishna+Rayabharam+Stage+Drama+by+Srinu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78d8a8dd0f8b2163f6482f2407f166a701bd7a76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,216,168,221,15,139,33,99,246,72,47,36,7,241,102,167,1,189,122,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
