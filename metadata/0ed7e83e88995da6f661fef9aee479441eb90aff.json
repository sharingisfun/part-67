They dissected the nonstop Romney lies and Jonathan Alter (MSNBC Political Analyst and Bloomberg View Columnist), looks and the possibility these lies could work.\n\nMitt Romney dumps gasoline on his tax return fire Senator Harry Reid responded. Ed will get the latest from Rep. John Garamendi (D- CA).\n\nThe Associated Press nailed Paul Ryan on his request for stimulus funds, and Ryan pulls a Palin to try and dodge the question. John Nichols (Washington Correspondent of The Nation), and Ruth Conniff (Political Editor of The Progressive Magazine), looks at Ryan's trouble with the truth.\n\nAnd when a problem comes along, 'you must whip it'. Devo's Jerry Casale premiered his band's song dedicated to Mitt Romney's dog.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ed7e83e88995da6f661fef9aee479441eb90aff","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+8-16-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ed7e83e88995da6f661fef9aee479441eb90aff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,215,232,62,136,153,93,166,246,97,254,249,174,228,121,68,30,185,10,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
