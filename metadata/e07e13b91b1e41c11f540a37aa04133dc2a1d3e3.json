Apart from his alias as Yagya, Gumundsson creates his music on computer with figures like Brian Eno, Philip Glass, Maurizio, and Wolfgang Voigt providing inspiration. Like a lot of his peers and influences, Gumundsson aims to compose material that sounds as organic and as free-flowing as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e07e13b91b1e41c11f540a37aa04133dc2a1d3e3","amp;dn":"Yagya+-+The+Inescapable+Decay+of+My+Heart+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e07e13b91b1e41c11f540a37aa04133dc2a1d3e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,126,19,185,27,30,65,193,31,84,10,55,170,4,19,61,194,161,211,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
