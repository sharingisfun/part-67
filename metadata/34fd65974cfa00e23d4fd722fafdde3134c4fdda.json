But it's also about victorious faith and spiritual triumph over some of the greatest political and religious forces known in the 16th century.\n\nA simple God-seeking man, William Tyndale somehow became one of the most wanted men in England and all of Europe. Pursued by King Henry VIII, Lord Chancellor Sir Thomas More, and the Pope's personal legate Cardinal Wolsey, he darted across Europe to avoid capture -- always pushing to complete the task that obsessed him.\n\nThe Radicals:\nThis 1990 movie is the true story of spiritual martyrs Michael and Margretha Sattler who were put to death by the Catholic Church in 1527 because of their beliefs.     It is also the story of a deep love between two people who shared the same beliefs, and who had the inner courage to follow those beliefs knowing they could die for them.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34fd65974cfa00e23d4fd722fafdde3134c4fdda","amp;dn":"POtHS+3+-+Bible+-+84+-+Stars+of+the+Reformation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34fd65974cfa00e23d4fd722fafdde3134c4fdda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,253,101,151,76,250,0,226,61,79,215,34,250,253,222,49,52,196,253,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
