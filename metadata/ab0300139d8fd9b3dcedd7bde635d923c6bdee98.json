But the first and most valuable treasures they looted were the Crown Jewels of the Holy Roman Empire. In HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Holy Relics, bestselling author Sidney Kirkpatrick tells the riveting and never-before-told true story of how an American college professor turned Army sleuth recovered these cherished symbols of HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Thousand-Year Reich before they could become a rallying point in the creation of a Fourth and equally unholy Reich.\nAnticipating the Allied invasion of Nazi Germany, ReichsfÃƒÂ¼hrer Heinrich Himmler had ordered a top-secret bunker carved deep into the bedrock beneath NÃƒÂ¼rnberg castle. Inside the well-guarded chamber was a specially constructed vault that held the plundered treasures Hitler valued the most: the Spear of Destiny (reputed to have been used to pierce ChristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s side while he was on the cross) and the Crown Jewels of the Holy Roman Empire, ancient artifacts steeped in medieval mysticism and coveted by world rulers from Charlemagne to Napoleon. But as Allied bombers rained devastation upon NÃƒÂ¼rnberg and the U.S. Seventh Army prepared to invade the city Hitler called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the soul of the Nazi Party,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ five of the most precious relics, all central to the coronation ceremony of a would-be Holy Roman Emperor, vanished from the vault. Who took them? And why? The mystery remained unsolved for months after the warÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end, until the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, ordered Lieutenant Walter Horn, a German-born art historian on leave from U.C. Berkeley, to hunt down the missing treasures.To accomplish his mission, Horn must revisit the now-rubble-strewn landscape of his youth and delve into the ancient legends and arcane mysticism surrounding the antiquities that Hitler had looted in his quest for world domination. Horn searches for clues in the burnt remains of HimmlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s private castle and follows the trail of neo-Nazi Ã¢â‚¬Å“Teutonic  KnightsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ charged with protecting a vast hidden  fortune in plundered gold and other treasure. Along  the way, Horn has to confront his own demons:  how members of his family and former academic  colleagues subverted scholarly research to help  legitimize HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theories of Aryan supremacy  and the Master Race. What Horn discovers on his  investigative odyssey is so explosive that his final  report will remain secret for decades.\n\nDrawing on unpublished interrogation and  intelligence reports, as well as on diaries, letters,  journals, and interviews in the United States and Germany, Kirkpatrick tells this riveting and disturbing story with cinematic detail and revealsÃ¢â‚¬â€ for the first timeÃ¢â‚¬â€how a failed Vienna art student, obsessed with the occult and dreams of his own grandeur, nearly succeeded in creating a Holy Reich rooted in a twisted reinvention of medieval and Church history.\n64kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab0300139d8fd9b3dcedd7bde635d923c6bdee98","amp;dn":"Sidney+D.+Kirkpatrick+-+Hitler%27s+Holy+Relics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab0300139d8fd9b3dcedd7bde635d923c6bdee98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,3,0,19,157,143,217,179,220,237,215,189,230,53,217,35,198,189,238,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
