Here, for the first time, he tells the story of his lifelong obsession with football, in an honest and revealing book which captures the extraordinary camaraderie, the soul-destroying tensions and the high-octane thrills of the modern game as never before. Born in the Liverpool suburb of Huyton in 1980, Steven first joined Liverpool as a YTS trainee and played his first game for the first team aged just 18. His career has gone from strength to strength ever since and he is now the team's captain and its lynchpin. Liverpool's incredible comeback in the Champions' League final in Istanbul in May 2005, recovering from a 3-goal deficit against AC Milan to win on penalties, is testament to the amazing power Gerrard has over his team. His presence on the pitch is a force to be reckoned with and places him amongst the very first rank of players in the world. A relatively private figure, Steven has rarely spoken out in public. Now, his legions of fans will be allowed an intimate glimpse of what makes their hero tick. He speaks for the first time about the torturous will-he-won't-he Chelsea rumours and his undying passion for Liverpool. We experience first-hand the highs of winning in Istanbul and elsewhere, as well as the occasional lows of being parted from his much-loved family and friends. And of course, the book contains a full blow-by-blow account of England's world cup campaign in Germany 2006. Steven Gerrard's book is the definitive football autobiography. Like its subject, it's honest, passionate and exhilarating. If Steven Gerrard isn't your hero yet, by the time you've read this he will be...\n\nHardcover: 320 pages\nPublisher: Transworld Publishers; First Edition edition (October 1, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 059305475X\nISBN-13: 978-0593054758\nProduct Dimensions: 9.3 x 6.4 x 1.8 inches\nShipping Weight: 1.7 pounds\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98ec9d8001e94fe81b9235fe472252d81fa0d989","amp;dn":"Steven+Gerrard+My+Autobiography+Complete+PDF+format+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98ec9d8001e94fe81b9235fe472252d81fa0d989","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,236,157,128,1,233,79,232,27,146,53,254,71,34,82,216,31,160,217,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
