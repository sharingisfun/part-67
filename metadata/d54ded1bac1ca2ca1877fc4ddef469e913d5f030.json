Medvedev is wounded and very strict, but Ermakov seems to have adjusted and is even helping out the Chechen gang  leader with computers.\n\nWhen Chechen leader - Aslan - learns that he can't get any money he let's the British man go home and get two million pounds to buy out his fiancee. As a gesture of generosity he lets go Ermakov.\n\nThe Brit - John - is trying to get the money, and Ivan experiences a post-war life for a Chechnya veteran in his town - no money, no work, ill father.
