It then was featured in the color comic Marvel Premiere #38 (Oct. 1977).\n\nin late 1977 or early 1978, co-creator Ploog left Marvel in a contract dispute while in the midst of drawing a 60-page &quot;Weirdworld&quot; story, written by Moench, that the company had planned to publish as one of its Marvel Comics Super Special series of one-shots. Ploog recalled in 1998 he had &quot;a disagreement with [editor-in-chief] Jim Shooter. I had moved to a farm in Minnesota, and agreed to do a hand-colored 'Weirdworld' story. Marvel backed out of the deal after I had started. I can't remember the details, but it doesn't matter. I think I was ready to move on. Marvel and I were both changing.&quot; Richard Marschall, the story's editor, said in 1978 time that Ploog had been given four months to complete the art, and when it became evident the deadline would not be met, arranged to publish the story in two 30-page installments, giving Ploog two more months. Ploog sent Marvel photocopies of the first 31 pages, and was paid for them. During this time, Marvel had given work-for-hire contracts to its freelancers, many of whom, including Ploog, Frank Brunner, Jack Kirby, Don McGregor, Roger Slifer, and Roger Stern, refused to sign, resulting in cessation of work for Marvel. Ploog &quot;took himself off the project,&quot; said Marschall, and retained his original artwork. Moench's script was eventually published as a 106-page story illustrated by penciler John Buscema, inker Rudy Nebres, and airbrush colorist Peter Ledger as the three-part &quot;Warriors of the Shadow Realm&quot; in Marvel Comics Super Special #11-13 (Spring - Fall 1979).\n\nPloog returned to draw the first part of a &quot;Weirdworld&quot; trilogy, in Marvel Fanfare #24, (Jan. 1986), with Pat Broderick penciling the two subsequent issues (#25-26, May &amp; July 1986).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ede19e852ec771b8e6aa42e62bbc8233274b2551","amp;dn":"Weirdworld+%281976-1986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ede19e852ec771b8e6aa42e62bbc8233274b2551","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,225,158,133,46,199,113,184,230,170,66,230,43,188,130,51,39,75,37,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
