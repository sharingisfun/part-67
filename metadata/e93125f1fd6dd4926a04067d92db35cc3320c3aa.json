The band is Trevor Watts on alto, Jeff Clyne\non bass and John Stevens on drums, with Barry Guy playing bass on the title\ntrack.\n\n&quot;Tales Of Sadness&quot; starts with arco bass and a wonderful melody on the alto,\nslowly, very slowly increasing the intensity till they're playing up a storm\nafter a while,with especially Watts doing an extraordinary expressive piece\nwhile staying within the tune, overblowing like crazy, till absolute madness,\nrelentlessly, without losing sight of the melody which suddenly comes shining\nback through the mayhem like a sudden smile breaking through the tears on a\nface full of agony and fear. This track is nothing short of phenomenal, and by\nitself worth buying the album for.\n\nThe second piece, &quot;Judy's Smile 1&quot;, is less intense, yet equally beautiful, and\nit is continued on the second side of the vinyl LP with &quot;Judy's Smile 2&quot;, which\nstarts slowly with great bass-playing by Clyne, and perfect accents by Stevens\nfor a quiet almost gospel-like melody on the alto. Then Stevens starts pushing\nup the tempo, and the piece gains again a strong momentum, going beyond bop in\na more free fashion.\n\nAlso the last piece, with Barry Guy on arco, lifts the music into high spheres,\nfully delivering the title's content, without any need for further explanation,\nreverent, expansive, spiritual and full of inherent beauty and emotional\ndepth. Magnificent!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e93125f1fd6dd4926a04067d92db35cc3320c3aa","amp;dn":"Amalgam+-+Prayer+For+Peace+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e93125f1fd6dd4926a04067d92db35cc3320c3aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,49,37,241,253,109,212,146,106,4,6,125,146,219,53,204,51,32,195,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
