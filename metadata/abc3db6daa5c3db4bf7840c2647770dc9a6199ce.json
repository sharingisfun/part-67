Whether it's animals behaving oddly or even the planet that perplexes, each episode sees scientists studying baffling phenomena in a bid to understand what Mother Nature's really up to. The reasons behind incidents will vary, but there's one conclusion that we always reach: the world isn't as predictable as we'd like to think.\n\n\n\nEpisode 2 : Killer Whale Attack\n\nThis episode explores the life of the killer whale. In Mother's Day 2004 a grey whale is spotted from aboard popular tourist boat. Enthusiastic passengers enjoy the scene, but then it suddenly turns to a bloodbath when a pod of orcas launch a coordinated attack on a grey whale and her calf. It's first in a long chase. Streamlined and cunning, killer whales have many hunting techniques. They live and hunt together in cooperative pods much like a pack of wolves, and work together as they hunt.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2087 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 50:19.720\nNumber Of Parts: 8\nPart Size: 825 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc3db6daa5c3db4bf7840c2647770dc9a6199ce","amp;dn":"Ch5.Nature.Shock.2of8.Killer.Whale.Attack.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc3db6daa5c3db4bf7840c2647770dc9a6199ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,195,219,109,170,92,61,180,191,120,64,194,100,119,112,220,154,97,153,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
