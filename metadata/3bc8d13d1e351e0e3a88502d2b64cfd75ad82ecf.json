In this book the author takes a close look at the culture of ski resorts and the shocking behavior which goes unregulated by not only government agencies, but by resort owners and employees alike. In the modern day nanny state, the lack of safety at ski resorts will frighten most. Follow along with the author as he takes you through a collection of stories obtained in a single winter season he spent working at an upstate New York ski resort.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bc8d13d1e351e0e3a88502d2b64cfd75ad82ecf","amp;dn":"Rants+From+The+Mountain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bc8d13d1e351e0e3a88502d2b64cfd75ad82ecf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,200,209,61,30,53,30,14,58,136,80,45,43,100,207,215,90,216,46,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
