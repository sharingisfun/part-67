It won the PrÃƒÂªmio Sharp for best album in 1988 and sold more than 150,000 copies. Many of Cazuza's hits are from this album, such as Ideologia, Brasil and Faz Parte do Meu Show.\n\nThe album cover tried to create some controversy. As one can see on its cover, it mixes swastika and star of David. It also presents lots of critics to Brazilian and world politics.\n\nIdeologia is considered one of the main albums in Cazuza's solo career as it is the first recording in which the singer tells about his relation with AIDS and death, as it was his first album after the discovery that he was infected with HIV virus.\n\nExact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 3 from 29.
