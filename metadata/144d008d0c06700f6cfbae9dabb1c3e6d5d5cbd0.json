(Ã£â€šÂ¨Ã£Æ’Â³Ã£â€šÂ¸Ã£â€šÂ§Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£Æ’â€œÃ£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’â€ž! Enjeru BÃ„Â«tsu!?) is a 13-episode Japanese anime television series produced by P.A. Works and Aniplex and directed by Seiji Kishi. The story was originally conceived by Jun Maeda, who also wrote the screenplay and composed the music with the group Anant-Garde Eyes, with original character design by Na-Ga; both Maeda and Na-Ga are from the visual novel brand Key, who produced such titles as Kanon, Air, and Clannad. The anime aired in Japan between April 3 and June 26, 2010. An original video animation episode was released on December 22, 2010. The story takes place in the afterlife and focuses on Otonashi, a boy who lost his memories of his life after dying. He is enrolled into the afterlife school and meets a girl named Yuri who invites him to join the Afterlife BattlefrontÃ¢â‚¬â€an organization she leads which fights against God. The Battlefront fight against the student council president Angel, a girl with supernatural powers.\n\n\nKey worked in collaboration with ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine to produce the project into a media franchise. Two manga series are serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine: one illustrated by Haruka Komowata, which began serialization in the December 2009 issue, and the other drawn by Yuriko Asami, which started in the May 2010 issue. A series of illustrated short stories written by Maeda and illustrated by GotoP were also serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine between the November 2009 and May 2010 issues. Two Internet radio shows were produced to promote Angel Beats!. It was reported in 2010 that Jun Maeda was writing the scenario for a possible future video game adaptation of Angel Beats!.\n\n\nAngel Beats! received generally positive reviews by critics. The integration of various individual elements together, such as musical performances, humor and action, was praised in one review, but panned in another, saying that the story is overloaded with too many elements. P.A Works was praised for the animation of the action sequences and attention to detail with the weapons used. A major flaw noted by critics, however, is that the anime is too short, which leaves many of the characters with untold back-stories. The anime was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the 14th Japan Media Arts Festival in 2010.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:144d008d0c06700f6cfbae9dabb1c3e6d5d5cbd0","amp;dn":"Angel+Beats%21_BDRip_1080P_BIG5_MKV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"144d008d0c06700f6cfbae9dabb1c3e6d5d5cbd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,77,0,141,12,6,112,15,108,251,174,157,171,177,195,230,213,213,203,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
