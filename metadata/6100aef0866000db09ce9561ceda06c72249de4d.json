This is literally live in that Kevin answers questions sent in during the show via Twitter and Facebook - this is simply 45 minutes of Kevin Smith, an iPad and a sofa.\n\nYou can actually stream this online without an account etc, but it's always good to have a video rip (plus I didn't even know this existed, it's not listed on IMDb). You can stream it if you'd prefer here: http://www.epixhd.com/kevin-smith/\n\nRipped direct from the online stream. As with my other Epix rip, the only processing after that was converting the flash video to xvid and remuxing the source audio.\n\n\nFilesize:       444mb\nRuntime:        44m 43s\nDimensions:     548 x 308\nFramrate:       23.976\n\nVideo format:   xvid (avi)\nVideo Bitrate:  ~1250kbps\nAspect ratio:   16:9\n\nAudio format:   mp3\nAudio bitrate:  128kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6100aef0866000db09ce9561ceda06c72249de4d","amp;dn":"Epix+Live%3A+Kevin+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6100aef0866000db09ce9561ceda06c72249de4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,0,174,240,134,96,0,219,9,206,149,97,206,218,6,199,34,73,222,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
