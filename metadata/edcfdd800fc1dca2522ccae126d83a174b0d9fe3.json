The results of the early recordings were released as a series of five 90 minute cassette tapes and eventually as a CD collection called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Basement TapesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 2003. \n\nThe second home studio has come together almost a quarter century later. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Inquisitors of the Crimson HexagonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is made up from an initial set of recordings laid down during April and May 2012. The album is inspired by a short story written by Jorges Luis Borges entitled, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Library of BabelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edcfdd800fc1dca2522ccae126d83a174b0d9fe3","amp;dn":"United+States+of+Equanimity%3A+Inquisitors+of+the+Crimson+Hexagon%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edcfdd800fc1dca2522ccae126d83a174b0d9fe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,207,221,128,15,193,220,162,82,44,202,225,38,216,58,23,75,13,159,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
