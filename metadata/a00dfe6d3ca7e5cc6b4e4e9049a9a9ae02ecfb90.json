Mount-batten is gone. Ranger Mike Danger is in pieces. Dare is injured, with no way to get help. So how can he rescue his sister? Monty's cryptic last words aren't any help: 'Use the one thing in Madland that isn't a toy.'\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a00dfe6d3ca7e5cc6b4e4e9049a9a9ae02ecfb90","amp;dn":"Fables+120+%28c2c+%26amp%3B+noAds%29+%28theProletariat-DCP%29+%5BDCP-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a00dfe6d3ca7e5cc6b4e4e9049a9a9ae02ecfb90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,13,254,109,60,167,229,204,107,78,78,144,73,169,169,174,2,236,251,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
