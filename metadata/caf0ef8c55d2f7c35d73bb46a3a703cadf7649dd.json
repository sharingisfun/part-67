His crimes, committed around his hometown of Plainfield, Wisconsin, gathered widespread notoriety after authorities discovered Gein had exhumed corpses from local graveyards and fashioned trophies and keepsakes from their bones and skin. After police found body parts in his house in 1957, Gein confessed to killing two women: tavern owner Mary Hogan in 1954, and a Plainfield hardware store owner, Bernice Worden in 1957.\nInitially found unfit to stand trial, following confinement in a mental health facility he was tried in 1968 for the murder of Worden and sentenced to life imprisonment, which he spent in a mental hospital. The body of Bernice Worden was found in Gein's shed; her head and the head of Mary Hogan were found inside his house. Robert H. Gollmar, the judge in the Gein case, wrote: &quot;Due to prohibitive costs, Gein was tried for only one murder Ã¢â‚¬â€ that of Mrs. Worden.&quot;[2] With fewer than three murders attributed to him, Gein does not meet the traditional definition of a serial killer.[3] His case influenced the creation of several fictional serial killers, including Norman Bates from Psycho, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Jame Gumb from The Silence of the Lambs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caf0ef8c55d2f7c35d73bb46a3a703cadf7649dd","amp;dn":"Ed+Gein+The+Ghoul+of+Plainfield","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caf0ef8c55d2f7c35d73bb46a3a703cadf7649dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,240,239,140,85,210,247,195,93,115,187,70,163,167,3,202,223,118,73,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
