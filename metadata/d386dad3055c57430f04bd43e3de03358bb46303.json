Based on Games Workshop's popular tabletop wargame, Warhammer 40,000, Dark Crusade was released on October 9, 2006. The expansion features two new races, the Tau Empire and the Necrons. Including the Imperial Guard from Dawn of War's first expansion pack Winter Assault, this means a total of seven playable races in this expansion\n\nUnlike Winter Assault, Dark Crusade is a standalone expansion that does not require prior installation of Dawn of War or Winter Assault to play, allowing the user to play as all seven factions in both single player Skirmish and Campaign modes.\n\nParallel to the release of Dark Crusade, THQ also released a triple pack of Dawn of War, Winter Assault, and Dark Crusade, dubbed Dawn of War Anthology. The case is embossed with images of all the faction leaders of the campaign dressed in their respective wargear.\n\nScreens:\n\n1:http://bayimg.com/babjpAAEe\n2:http://bayimg.com/CAbjBAaEe\n3:http://bayimg.com/CAbJcaAEE\n\n\n\nParametrs: \n\nPentium 4 2.4 GHz, 512 MB RAM, graphic card 64 MB (GeForce 3 Ti200 or better), 2.5 GB HDD, Windows 98 SE/Me/2000/XP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d386dad3055c57430f04bd43e3de03358bb46303","amp;dn":"Warhammer+40%2C000+Dawn+of+War+%26ndash%3B+Dark+Crusade+%28ISO%29+%2B+Serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d386dad3055c57430f04bd43e3de03358bb46303","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,134,218,211,5,92,87,67,15,4,189,67,227,222,3,53,139,180,99,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
