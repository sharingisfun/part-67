The simple stick figure man is just trying to stay alive, which is just how people sometimes feel. A great quick break in a stressful day, stick man makes you feel like your life's not quite so bad after all. Big Thumbs Up!&quot;\n\nAnd now about the rules.\n\nSo imagine that the world has gone mad and crazy balls are falling from heaven.\nWhat should a poor Man caught in this insane weather do?\n\nOf course run and scream!\n\nThe objective of the game is to keep the Man alive. A player should try to escape from as many balls as possible. The final score is the number of the balls that the Man has managed to avoid.\nThe Man runs to the left and to the right, screams and from time to time releases himself.Remember that running not always means salvation, sometimes in order not to be killed a player can leave the Man stay still for a second or two.\n\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be surprised if in a week you will find yourself playing it with the same enthusiasm.\n\nFeatures:\n- stunning design;\n- funny sound;\n- OpenFeint Leaderboards - compete with the whole world;\n- OpenFeint Achievements - unlock them all;\n\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let the balls kill you! =)Ã¢â‚¬Æ’\n***** Have Fun! *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5973985fca028a95a3823a369681f60d9188a221","amp;dn":"Crazy+Survival+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5973985fca028a95a3823a369681f60d9188a221","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,115,152,95,202,2,138,149,163,130,58,54,150,129,246,13,145,136,162,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
