It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in October 2010.[6] The game is based in a post-apocalyptic environment in and around Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nEven though it directly succeeds it in order of Fallout game releases and also shares its engine, Fallout: New Vegas is not a direct sequel to Fallout 3,[10][11] though the game offers a similar action role-playing experience to Fallout 3. The game marks the return of many elements found in previous Fallout titles; many employees of Obsidian Entertainment previously worked for the now-defunct Black Isle Studios on Fallout and Fallout 2.[12]\n\nThe game currently holds the record for the most lines of dialogue in a single-player action role-playing game. The game contains around 65,000 lines of dialogue, beating its predecessor and previous record holder Fallout 3 which contained 40,000 lines of dialogue.[13]\n\n\n\nDeveloper(s) \tObsidian Entertainment\nBethesda Game Studios (patches)\nPublisher(s) \tBethesda Softworks (US, UK, ROI),\nNamco Bandai Games (EU, AU, NZ)[1]\nDesigner(s) \tJosh Sawyer (project director), John Gonzalez (creative lead),[2] Chris Avellone, Eric Fenstermaker, Travis Stout (writers)\nComposer(s) \tInon Zur[3]\nSeries \tFallout\nEngine \tGamebryo\nVersion \t1.4.0.525 (PC)[4]\nPlatform(s) \tMicrosoft Windows\nPlayStation 3\nXbox 360[5]\nRelease date(s) \t\n\n    NA October 19, 2010[6]\n\n    AUS October 21, 2010[7]\n\n    EU October 22, 2010[6]\n\nGenre(s) \tAction role-playing, open world\nMode(s) \tSingle-player\nRating(s) \t\n\n    ACB: MA15+[8]\n    BBFC: 18[9]\n    CERO: Z\n    ESRB: M\n    OFLC: R18\n    PEGI: 18+[6]\n    USK: 18\n\nMedia/distribution \tBlu-ray Disc\nDVD\nSystem requirements\nOperating system \tWindows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7\nCPU \tDual-core 2 GHz\nMemory \t2 GB RAM\nHard drive space \t6.9 GB (not including DLC)\nGraphics hardware \tNVIDIA GeForce 6200 128 MB or ATi Radeon X1300 XT 128 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e4012085dcaaab07a83133eb79c7e5e686ee86b","amp;dn":"Fallout+New+Vegas%2F%2FUNLIMITED+EDITION+-NSSAndrew-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e4012085dcaaab07a83133eb79c7e5e686ee86b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,64,18,8,93,202,170,176,122,131,19,62,183,156,126,94,104,110,232,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
