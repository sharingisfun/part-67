It \nÃ‚Âº covers all fatigue aspects of ground vehicles and other \nÃ‚Âº machinery.\nÃ‚Âº          \nÃ‚Âº Assessment can be made for all ranges of strength as \nÃ‚Âº durability (infinite life), finite life and static \nÃ‚Âº strength. FEMFAT can easiliy fit into an existing CAE-\nÃ‚Âº process because a multitude of FEA-interfaces and load-time-\nÃ‚Âº data interfaces are provided together with a comprehensive \nÃ‚Âº material data base. Fatigue analysis can be performed for \nÃ‚Âº cast and machined components but also for joints like seam \nÃ‚Âº welds, spot welds and self piercing rivets.\nÃ‚Âº          \nÃ‚Âº FEMFAT is split up in several modules to reflect the \nÃ‚Âº requirements for different fields of application. \nÃ‚Âº Additionally to the fatigue analysis modules there is a \nÃ‚Âº range of tools for related topics like friction bearings, \nÃ‚Âº pre- and postprocessing for acoustic simulation and \nÃ‚Âº submodeling/data mapping.\nÃ‚Âº          \nÃ‚Âº For test engineers we provide an extra tool which covers \nÃ‚Âº all kind of signal processing, cycle counting including \nÃ‚Âº data compression tasks. Another advanced feature is to \nÃ‚Âº automatically perform virtual iteration for MBS-models to \nÃ‚Âº generate valuable load spectra","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a9174807d4f2676c9569926b19bd44f1ebe6f7b","amp;dn":"ECS_FEMFAT_V4.8b_WIN32_64-LND","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a9174807d4f2676c9569926b19bd44f1ebe6f7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,145,116,128,125,79,38,118,201,86,153,38,177,155,212,79,30,190,111,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
