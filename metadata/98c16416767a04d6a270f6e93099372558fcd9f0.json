A well paid job, friends, parties, girls and nothing to tie him down. But when he is invited back to his old school to join several other ex-students including Alex and Jim in talking about their personal achievements, something goes wrong. Ben is the only speaker not to be asked a question by the school kids. This triggers a year of soulsearching and looking for answers in all the wrong places. From his best friend Andy whose solution is that they both take another holiday, to his mentor Sam who loans him a sports car in the belief that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing like excessive speed to resolve emotional turmoil. Not even BenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father or friends Nick and Em can offer much in the way of meaningful guidance. Of course, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not easy seeking enlightenment in nightclubs, or on the ski fields of New Zealand, and when you start dating a Russian tennis star things can get really complicated. As the poster boy for a generation desperate to tick every box, Ben begins to suspect that the meaning of life may well reside in the things heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already doing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and a girl he used to know.\n\n\nRelease Group: TASTE ( Scene )\nRelease Name: Any.Questions.For.Ben.2012.BDRiP.XviD-TASTE\nRelease Date: 27-07-2012\nFilename: Any.Questions.For.Ben.2012.BDRiP.XviD-TASTE.avi\nSource: Bluray\nSize: 1.3 GB\nGenre: Comedy\nVideo: XviD | 640Ãƒâ€”352 | 1249 Kbps\nAudio: English | AC3 | 448 Kbps\nSubs: N/A\nIMDB Rating: 6.0/10\nRT Critics: 5.6/10\nDirected By: Rob Sitch\nStarring: Josh Lawson, Rachael Taylor and Daniel Henshall\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.sceper.eu/images/9OMEv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.sceper.eu/images/9OMEv.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.sceper.eu/images/U2LZD.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.sceper.eu/images/U2LZD.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.sceper.eu/images/Pw1lI.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.sceper.eu/images/Pw1lI.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98c16416767a04d6a270f6e93099372558fcd9f0","amp;dn":"Any.Questions.For.Ben.2012.BDRip.XviD-TASTE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98c16416767a04d6a270f6e93099372558fcd9f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,193,100,22,118,122,4,214,162,112,246,233,48,153,55,37,88,252,217,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
