I am a fan of the movie, and could no longer find any seeders. The torrent came with no NFO or README, and not finding any information on &quot;CG&quot;, I cannot confirm the original author/creator. I apologize.\n\n\n\nDead Awake\n\nDesmond Caine (Stephen Baldwin) suffers from insomnia and spends his nights walking the streets. One night, he witnesses a murder, generating a strange chain of events in his life.\n\n\nGenre: Action | Thriller\nIMDb rating: 5.0/10 from 518 users\nRotten Tomatoes: 44% (avg 2.9/5) from 273 ratings\n\n\n\nNote from me (torrent uploader): sometimes you rent obscure movies nobody uploads, and they're absolute shit. But this is a damn gem of a movie, and the more attention you put into the details, the more satisfying the ending can be. You may hate a Baldwin, but this is a unique movie with witty dialogue.
