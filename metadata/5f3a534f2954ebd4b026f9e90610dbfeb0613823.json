The world's economy virtually revolves around petroleum. The word 'petroleum' is coined from two Latin words - 'petra' and 'oleum'. Petra means rock, and oleum means oil, and these words, in brief, tell their story very well. Petroleum is formed from the remains of ancient living things. Man has been using oil for thousands of years. But we began to consume oil in vast quantities only in recent times. Oil has now become one of our planet's most valuable commodities, essential to our daily life. This means that very large quantities of oil are being dug out, and the world's oil supplies are gradually running out. A real, viable alternative for oil is yet to be discovered. This issue of Tell Me Why tells you the fascinating story of the world's most valuable natural resource - one that rules the modern world, and literally, makes it go!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f3a534f2954ebd4b026f9e90610dbfeb0613823","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+Petroleum+%28Tell+Me+Why+%2371%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f3a534f2954ebd4b026f9e90610dbfeb0613823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,58,83,79,41,84,235,212,176,38,249,233,6,16,219,254,176,97,56,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
