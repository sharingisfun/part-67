'Last Living Souls' is marked by acoustic strumming and piano melodies, while 'Kids With Guns' threads a sample of Salt-N-Pepa's 'Push It' through a multi-faceted musical backdrop. The collective puts a weird spin on seductive soul with 'Every Planet We Reach Is Dead', while 'White Light' starts off in similar territory as Blur's raucous 'Song 2' before being interrupted by an angelic interlude. For an extra dash of oddness, actor Dennis Hopper offers spoken-word intonations atop 'Fire Coming Out of a Monkey's Head'.\nThe London Community Gospel Choir can be heard on the title track while De La Soul make an appearance on the albums first single 'Feel Good Inc'. There are also guest spots by Blondie's Deborah Harry, rock legend Ike Turner, the Happy Mondays' Shaun Ryder and underground rapper MF Doom sprinkled throughout other cuts. The Gorillaz are back in town!\n\ntrack listing\n\n     1. Intro\n     2. Last Living Souls\n     3. Kids With Guns\n     4. O Green World\n     5. Dirty Harry\n     6. Feel Good Inc.\n     7.
