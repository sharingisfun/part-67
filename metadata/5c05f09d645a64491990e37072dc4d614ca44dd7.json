Hadley (AgentParsec). It shares the same gameplay elements as the original - you must collect 8 pages while avoiding the enemy. This is not intended to be a copy - simply a way for people who loved Slender to be able to face their fear on a different map with the same awesome gameplay. There are some differences which will make playing a somewhat unique experience - different AI, new sounds, and a different environment.\n\nv1.1 of Elementary has been released. \n\n-Fixed bug where Slendy would chase player every time\n-Removed a door\n-Altered bear spawns\n-Added Sky\n-New Poem at end","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c05f09d645a64491990e37072dc4d614ca44dd7","amp;dn":"Slender+-+Elementary+v1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c05f09d645a64491990e37072dc4d614ca44dd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,5,240,157,100,90,100,73,25,144,227,112,114,220,77,97,76,164,77,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
