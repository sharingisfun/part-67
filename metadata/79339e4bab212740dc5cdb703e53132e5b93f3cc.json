Use your finger to draw with chalk, but be careful, it will not last for long. Make your ball hit other ones to recover chalk and don't let it fall. Easy to learn, hard to master!\n\nChalk ball has two different game modes, adventures and survival.\n\nIn Adventure there are lots of exciting scenarios with different characteristics, you travel to find and hit the star. Start with The easy way, follow Nautilus in Two leagues under the sea, chase the evil Badball and discover the Geometry Abduction.\n\nIn Survival you &quot;just&quot; have to survive while balls keep appearing. Don't let our ball drop and keep collecting points as long as you can.\nThere are four levels of difficulty from easy to insane and lots of achievements to unlock.\n\nDo you have ninja reflex?\nCan you make enough points to become a Jedi Knight?\nWhat about managing a swarm of balls?\nWho will be the first to become a Pill Master?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79339e4bab212740dc5cdb703e53132e5b93f3cc","amp;dn":"Chalk+Ball+1.4+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79339e4bab212740dc5cdb703e53132e5b93f3cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,51,158,75,171,33,39,64,220,92,219,112,62,83,19,46,91,147,243,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
