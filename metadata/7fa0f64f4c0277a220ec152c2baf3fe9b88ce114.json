It has translations of key sacred texts of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism, and Islam. The series was edited by the famous linguist and scholar of comparative religion, Max MÃƒÂ¼ller. He wrote three of the volumes, and collaborated on three others. The SBE has been designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as part of the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.sacred-texts.com/sbe/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.sacred-texts.com/sbe/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Books_of_the_East&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Books_of_the_East&lt;/a&gt;\n\n01 The Upanishads Part One\n02 The Sacred Laws of the Aryas Part One\n03 The Sacred Books of China Part One\n04 The Zend Avesta Part One\n05 Pahlavi Texts Part One\n06 The Quran Part One\n07 The Institutes of Vishnu\n08 The Bhagavadgita The Sanatsugatiya And the Anugita\n09 The Quran Part Two\n10 The Dhammapada and the Sutta Nipata\n11 Buddhist Suttas\n12 The Brahmana Part One\n13 Vinaya Texts Part One\n14 The Sacred Laws of the Aryas Part Two\n15 The Upanishads Part Two\n16 The Sacred Books of China Part Two\n17 Vinaya Texts Part Two\n18 Pahlavi Texts Part Two\n19 Fo Sho Hing Tsan King\n20 Vinaya Texts Part Three\n21 The Saddharma Pundarika\n22 The Gaina Sutras Part One\n23 The Zend Avesta Part Two\n24 Pahlavi Texts Part Three\n25 The Laws of Manu\n26 The Satapatha Brahmana Part Two\n27 The Sacred Books of China Part Three\n28 The Sacred Books of China Part Four\n29 The Grihya Sutras Part One\n30 The Grihya Sutras Part Two\n31 The Zend Avesta Part Three\n32 Vedic Hymns Part One\n33 The Minor Law Books Part One\n34 The Vedanta Sutras Part One\n35 The Questions of King Milinda Part One\n36 The Questions of King Milinda Part Two\n37 Pahlavi Texts Part Four\n38 The Vedanta Sutras Part Two\n39 The Sacred Books of China Part Five\n40 The Sacred Books of China Part Six\n41 The Satapatha Brahmana Part Three\n42 Hymns of the Atharva Veda\n43 The Satapatha Brahmana Part Four\n44 The Satapatha Brahmana Part Five\n45 The Gaina Sutras Part Two\n46 Vedic Hymns Part Two\n47 Pahlavi Texts Part Five\n48 Vedanta Sutras Part Three\n49 Buddhist Mahayana Texts\n50 General Index\nfilelist.txt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fa0f64f4c0277a220ec152c2baf3fe9b88ce114","amp;dn":"Sacred+Books+of+the+East","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fa0f64f4c0277a220ec152c2baf3fe9b88ce114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,160,246,79,76,2,119,162,32,236,21,44,43,175,63,233,184,140,225,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
