What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 12 - Monday - Finals Week continues.. The five top contestants are greeted by Legendary British chef and MasterChef UK judge, John Torode, and a live cow. Torode announces that they must cook the perfect sauce to accompany the perfect steak. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c428ac4fb350b7cf69c6dcdfbcc3edf32ccfc9bf","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E68.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c428ac4fb350b7cf69c6dcdfbcc3edf32ccfc9bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,40,172,79,179,80,183,207,105,198,220,223,188,195,237,243,44,207,201,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
