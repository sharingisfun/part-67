The soft cover, a feature of the first four editions, has been replaced with a hard cover. Each edition of this text has grown in scope and depth to reflect the expanding body of knowledge related to therapeutic exercise. The fifth edition is no exception. There are many exciting trends in physical therapy which have influenced therapeutic exercise, and thus the content of this edition. These trends include entry-level physical therapist education rapidly progressing toward the Doctor of Physical Therapy degree, basic and clinical research lending evidence for critical analysis and support for therapeutic exercise interventions, and the practice of physical therapy moving toward direct access and autonomy enabling physical therapists with the assistance of physical therapist assistants to provide services to individuals with movement disorders that impair function.\nAlthough there are a number of new features in this edition directed toward the changes in education, clinical practice, and the healthcare environment, this text continues to provide a foundation of concepts, principles, and techniques on which an individualized program of therapeutic exercise can be built. This foundation remains an important component of the text. In addition to principles of exercise and background information on various pathologies and musculoskeletal surgeries, descriptions of exercise interventions and management guidelines are included to assist the reader in the development and progression of individualized and comprehensive therapeutic exercise programs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff257ae517806d96455d5778d2b6925a57673310","amp;dn":"Kisner+2007+Therapeutic+Exercise+5th+Foundations+and+Techniques","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff257ae517806d96455d5778d2b6925a57673310","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,37,122,229,23,128,109,150,69,93,87,120,210,182,146,90,87,103,51,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
