It has provided the model for European empires from Charlemagne to Queen Victoria and beyond, and is still the basis of comparison for investigators of modern imperialisms. By an exhaustive investigation of the changing meanings of certain key words and their use in the substantial remains of Roman writings and in the structures of Roman political life, this 2008 book seeks to discover what the Romans themselves thought about their imperial power in the centuries in which they conquered the known world and formed the empire of the first and second centuries AD.\n\n\n# Paperback: 232 pages\n# Publisher: Cambridge University Press; Reissue edition (August 11, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1107402794\n# ISBN-13: 978-1107402799","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51aa7a7f4cf6b99a791e26e7b633a3b6022f8969","amp;dn":"The+Language+of+Empire+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51aa7a7f4cf6b99a791e26e7b633a3b6022f8969","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,170,122,127,76,246,185,154,121,30,38,231,182,51,163,182,2,47,137,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
