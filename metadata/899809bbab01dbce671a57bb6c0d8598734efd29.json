Trailed by an inglorious history of go-nowhere schemes, he stumbles upon a chance of a lifetime in the form of legendary wrestler Gregorius the Great (Stanislaus Zbyszko). But there is no easy money in this underworld of shifting alliances, bottomless graft, and pummeled fleshÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œand Fabian soon learns the horrible price of his ambition. Luminously shot in the streets of London, Jules DassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Night and the City is film noir of the first order and one of the directorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crowning achievements.\n\nStuff I want as full disc either DVD5 or DVD9:\nDo the Right Thing (Disc 1) from Criterion Collection\nStraw Dogs (Disc 1) from Criterion Collection\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:899809bbab01dbce671a57bb6c0d8598734efd29","amp;dn":"Night+and+the+City+%281950%29+FULL+DVD5+%28ISO%29+Criterion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"899809bbab01dbce671a57bb6c0d8598734efd29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,152,9,187,171,1,219,206,103,26,87,187,108,13,133,152,115,78,253,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
