Immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City and perhaps the world. For three years, Neville has faithfully sent out daily radio messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. But he is not alone. Mutant victims of the plague -- The Infected -- lurk in the shadows... watching Neville's every move... waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But he knows he is outnumbered... and quickly running out of time.\n\nAlternate version from the 2 disk Special Edition\n\nUnfortunately the disk with the original movie is too badly scratched to rip...sorry.\n\nXvid avi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc65ee27f00982c636e0b5bbc89b244271b6d734","amp;dn":"I+Am+Legend+-+Alternate+Version+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc65ee27f00982c636e0b5bbc89b244271b6d734","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,101,238,39,240,9,130,198,54,224,181,187,200,155,36,66,113,182,215,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
