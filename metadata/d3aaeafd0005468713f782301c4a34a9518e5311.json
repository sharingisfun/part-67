Jonah Panghammer, bottle imp extraordinaire, had a plan: Ali Baba would find a treasure so rich he could give up thieving. Briar Rose would wake up and be allowed to go home. The Snow Queen would finally realize what her life could be like without the evil empire. And Jonah himself would be free to go his own way for once. Too bad Hadeon the Destroyer showed up to ruin everything.\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3aaeafd0005468713f782301c4a34a9518e5311","amp;dn":"Fairest+06+%282012%29+%28c2c+%26amp%3B+noAds%29+%28theProletariat-DCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3aaeafd0005468713f782301c4a34a9518e5311","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,170,234,253,0,5,70,135,19,247,130,48,28,74,52,169,81,142,83,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
