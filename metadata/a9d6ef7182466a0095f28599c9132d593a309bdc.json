With Love steers clear of the fragile indie-pop we have come to expect from her. Her new project is a retro-pop album that feels like it could have been pulled out of your motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s record collection. Does she pull it off? Yes. This is a charming and unexpected salute to the female pop vocalists of RosieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s youth, proving that nostalgia does not have to be sentimental. Fans of her wispy acoustic past will be surprised to hear this record veer into territory reminiscent of Barbara Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, and early Amy Grant. Her musical homecoming is a commendable attempt to make the kind of art that makes her happy, and it unashamedly pulls on the heart strings of her listeners. With Love sidesteps irony in favor of a return to innocence, and this mostly comes across as refreshing.\n\ncd rippped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d6ef7182466a0095f28599c9132d593a309bdc","amp;dn":"Rosie+Thomas...With+Love%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d6ef7182466a0095f28599c9132d593a309bdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,214,239,113,130,70,106,0,149,242,133,153,201,19,45,89,58,48,155,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
