Actors Sue Cleaver (Eileen Grimshaw), Ryan Thomas (Jason Grimshaw), Brooke Vincent (Sophie Webster) and Ben Price (Nick Tilsley) travel to Kenya on a mission to put on a play with the aim of educating people about the dangers of HIV. The foursome continue rehearsals on their groundbreaking new play, but days before the premiere, the Corrie stars have to face the realities of life in Kenya head on. Visiting an HIV clinic and discovering the plight of Africa's abandoned street kids, their mission in Kenya gets personal. In a country where HIV costs over 70,000 lives every year the pressure is on to pull off the play and leave the African audience with a life-saving message.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:933cfa2b238bd5549564074d17ea3477022c826a","amp;dn":"Corrie+Goes+to+Kenya+PT2+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"933cfa2b238bd5549564074d17ea3477022c826a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,60,250,43,35,139,213,84,149,100,7,77,23,234,52,119,2,44,130,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
