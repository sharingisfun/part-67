Of course, it's not plain sailing and his ship, Providence, soon stumbles across a storm which forces the unlikely band of travellers together. The 13-part series promises &quot;a 21st century take on the classic 8th century iconic hero&quot; for Sky1. Newcomer Elliot Knight plays Sinbad while his nemesis Lord Akbari is played by Lost's Naveen Andrews. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tv.com/shows/sinbad-uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tv.com/shows/sinbad-uk/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVideo: 1280*720  (WEB-DL)\nContainer: x264 MKV\nAudio: DD5.1\nSubs: Custom NL (Instelbaar)r3p0\n\n\n\nWebsite......:\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1979918/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9006c1d9c1534115aef9151d77e3a29f583d96df","amp;dn":"SINBAD+%282012%29+S01e04+720p+%28Web-DL%29+NLsubs+TBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9006c1d9c1534115aef9151d77e3a29f583d96df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,6,193,217,193,83,65,21,174,249,21,29,119,227,162,159,88,61,150,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
