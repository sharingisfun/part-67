Pastor Jones is no stranger to drama. With a congregation comprised largely of outspoken black women, he never has to guess when his flock is upset. But even Pastor Jones is thrown for a loop when his high school girlfriend (Vivica A. Fox) turns up in the pews, and makes her presence known. Meanwhile, as the pastor's mother-in-law (Sheryl Lee Ralph) begins spreading vicious rumors, the future of his marriage rests in his ability to convince his wife that he would never stray.
