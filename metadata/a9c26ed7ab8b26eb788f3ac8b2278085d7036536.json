And the conservative response.\n\nPresident Obama arrives in battleground Colorado to highlight Romney's archaic stance on women's rights. Sandra Fluke (Attorney and WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rights Activist), was with the president today and she joins Ed for an exclusive interview tonight on the Republican war on women.\n\nNewt Gingrich defends Romney's big lie about the president's new welfare policy. Ed will ask E.J. Dionne (Senior Fellow at The Brookings Institution and Washington Post columnist), how far Republicans can take this latest lie.\n\nCongressman Paul Ryan and his &quot;immoral&quot; budget are at the top of Romney's VP short list. And both Democrats and Republicans seem to be jumping for joy.\n\nThe panel; Keith Boykin (CNBC Contributor and Democratic Strategist), Susan Del Percio (Republican Strategist and MSNBC Contributor), and Michael Murphy (Democratic Strategist) will weigh in on a possible Romney-Ryan ticket.\n\nAnd Republicans are pulling out all the stops to block the vote. Fmr. Rep. John Boccierri, (D-OH) looks at the fight for early voting rights for all residents in his state.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9c26ed7ab8b26eb788f3ac8b2278085d7036536","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+8-8-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9c26ed7ab8b26eb788f3ac8b2278085d7036536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,194,110,215,171,139,38,235,120,143,58,200,178,39,128,133,215,3,101,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
