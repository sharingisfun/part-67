Recorded while Tosh was touring the USA they show another, more reflective, side to Peter ToshÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fiery personality\n\nThe background and build up to the 1978 One Love Peace Concert was about as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“dreadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ as it was possible to get. Guns, politics, music and, most importantly, reconciliation as JamaicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s warring factions were brought together in an effort to stop the violence.\n\nTosh, no stranger to the islandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s volatility, seized his opportunity with both hands. With Jamaica's most important political dignitaries seated in front of him alongside the world's press and media Tosh played what was probably the most dynamic set of his life whre, in between songs, he launched into fierce attacks on JamaicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s political system.Nobody was spared from ToshÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s explosive invective.\n\nUnique rare pictures of Tosh from the period, excellent artwork and Harry Hawke's sleeve notes that contextualise the troubled times and place the background to the concert in its historical context together make a stunning package essential to any music lover. Real rebel music!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:009693e809aae9a8912e9acea47c7f7ecd3fde19","amp;dn":"Peter+Tosh+-+%26quot%3BTalking+Revolution%26quot%3B+-+2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"009693e809aae9a8912e9acea47c7f7ecd3fde19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,150,147,232,9,170,233,168,145,46,154,206,164,124,127,126,205,63,222,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
