Extract the files from the winrar archive.\n\n2. Run file &quot;Flight1 - FS Sound Studio (UNWRAPPED INSTALLER) - setup.exe&quot; and      install FS Sound Studio (no serial number is needed).\n\n\nUse file &quot;FS Sound Studio Manual.pdf&quot; for the manual.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:921c640727113ba2c47c9abe1f6569e31d6dc779","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+Flight1+-+FS+Sound+Studio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"921c640727113ba2c47c9abe1f6569e31d6dc779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,28,100,7,39,17,59,162,196,124,154,190,31,101,105,227,29,109,199,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
