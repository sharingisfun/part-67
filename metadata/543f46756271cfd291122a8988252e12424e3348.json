Hadley (AgentParsec). It shares the same gameplay elements as the original - you must collect 8 pages while avoiding the enemy. This is not intended to be a copy - simply a way for people who loved Slender to be able to face their fear on a different map with the same awesome gameplay. There are some differences which will make playing a somewhat unique experience - different AI, new sounds, and a different environment.\n\nv1.1 of the new map Hospice has been released. This map is much darker, tighter and harder than Sanatorium. Due to popular request, randomised page spawns have been added to this map.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:543f46756271cfd291122a8988252e12424e3348","amp;dn":"Slender+-+Hospice+v1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"543f46756271cfd291122a8988252e12424e3348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,63,70,117,98,113,207,210,145,18,42,137,136,37,46,18,66,78,51,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
