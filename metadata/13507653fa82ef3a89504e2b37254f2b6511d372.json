These tricks and tactics of defense help animals a lot in their survival on this planet. In this collection we meet some of the worlds most dangerous animals.\n\n\n\nEpisode 2 : Tarantulas\n\nThe Tarantula has prowled the Earth for some three hundred and fifty million years. A big spider, it's famous for its big teeth which inject paralyzing venom into prey.\n\nThey are tough predators and one species has been known to kill birds and raid nests, even South America's most dreaded Pit Viper isn't safe. But Tarantulas have enemies as well and although they take refuge in deep burrows, they are sometimes discovered and ferreted out.\n\nThis detailed programme introduces us to numerous species of Tarantulas to prove that they are not dangerous to man and that their private lives are worthy of fascination not revulsion.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2123 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x416\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.654:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 49:02.840\nNumber Of Parts: 8\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13507653fa82ef3a89504e2b37254f2b6511d372","amp;dn":"DC.World%27s.Most.Dangerous.Animals.2of8.Tarantulas.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13507653fa82ef3a89504e2b37254f2b6511d372","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,80,118,83,250,130,239,58,137,80,78,43,55,37,79,43,101,17,211,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
