It is a sunny day in mid-June. He drives an aging green Chevy Cavalier with a dusty dashboard and a window that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite shut,  producing a dull roar at highway speeds.\n \nBut the car is quiet for now, as are the noontime streets: gas stations,  boundless concrete, brick buildings with plywood windows. \nAn elderly homeless man approaches. It says he is homeless right on his \nsign, which also asks for money. He wears a torn jacket, too heavy for the  warm day, and a grimy red baseball cap. \n\nThe economist doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lock his doors or inch the car forward. Nor does \nhe go scrounging for spare change. He just watches, as if through one-way  glass. After a while, the homeless man moves along. \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“He had nice headphones,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says the economist, still watching in the \nrearview mirror. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Well, nicer than the ones I have. Otherwise, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look like he has many assets.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5a5d7aee3850d82ed488877623363ae63aee027","amp;dn":"Crimes+Against+Humanity+and+Civilization+The+Genocide+of+the+Arm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5a5d7aee3850d82ed488877623363ae63aee027","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,165,215,174,227,133,13,130,237,72,136,119,98,51,99,174,99,174,224,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
