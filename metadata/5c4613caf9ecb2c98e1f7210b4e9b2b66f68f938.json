Somehow they are in communication with each other, and with a few sensitive grownups. This has a bit of sci-fi, a bit of horror, a bit of melodrama, and a good deal of social commentary. It's a pity it's been so overlooked, anything with Carmen Maura is worth checking out.\n\nRipped from tape, in segmented mpg format - I apologize for the quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c4613caf9ecb2c98e1f7210b4e9b2b66f68f938","amp;dn":"Sur+la+terre+comme+au+ciel+%281992%29+Carmen+Maura+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c4613caf9ecb2c98e1f7210b4e9b2b66f68f938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,70,19,202,249,236,178,201,142,31,114,16,180,233,178,182,111,104,249,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
