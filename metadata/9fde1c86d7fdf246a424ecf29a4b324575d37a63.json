Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fde1c86d7fdf246a424ecf29a4b324575d37a63","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+22+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fde1c86d7fdf246a424ecf29a4b324575d37a63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,222,28,134,215,253,242,70,164,36,236,242,154,75,50,69,117,211,122,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
