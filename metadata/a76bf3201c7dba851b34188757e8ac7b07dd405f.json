Over the next three years Obama accelerates drone attacks as an alterÃ‚Â­native to putting troops on the ground in Pakistan, and becomes increasingly reliant on the Special Forces, whose hunting of al-Qaeda illuminates the path out of an unwinÃ‚Â­nable war in Afghanistan.\n\n One of the most trusted and acclaimed national security correspondents in the country, David Sanger of the New York Times takes readers deep inside the Obama adminisÃ‚Â­trationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most perilous decisions: The president dispatchÃ‚Â­es an emergency search team to the Gulf when the White House briefly fears the Taliban may have obtained the Bomb, but he rejects a plan in late 2011 to send in Special Forces to recover a stealth drone that went down in Iran. Obama overrules his advisers and takes the riskiest path in killing Osama bin Laden, and ignores their advice when he helps oust Hosni Mubarak from the presidency of Egypt.\n\nPresident Obama Middle Oriental stance is very problematic for the future of Israel, even so at all has been done on will Go program of nuclear arms, which am quite serious considering the Iranian the President has promised his people to &quot;blow Israel of the map&quot; when those are nothing least that speech of hate laced with a call in action.

It is for this that one has to ask, why Obama is not taking action and by not doing anything is inadvertently that causes the future of the big Israel peril? He thinks in this. \n\n\nThe surprise is his aggressiveness,a key ambassador who works closely with Obama reports.\n\n Yet the president has also pivoted American foreign policy away from the attritional wars of the past decade, attempting to preserve AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence with a lighter, defter touchÃ¯Â¿Â½ all while focusing on a new era of diplomacy in Asia and reconfiguring Americas role during a time of economic turmoil and austerity.\n\n As the world seeks to understand whether there is an Obama Doctrine, Confront and Conceal is a fascinating, unflinching accounts....................","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a76bf3201c7dba851b34188757e8ac7b07dd405f","amp;dn":"Confront+and+Conceal+Obama%27s+Secret+Wars+and+Surprising+Use+of+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a76bf3201c7dba851b34188757e8ac7b07dd405f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,107,243,32,28,125,186,133,27,52,24,135,87,232,172,123,7,221,64,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
