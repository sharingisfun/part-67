It was directed by Joe Johnston and is based on Chris Van Allsburg's popular 1981 picture book of the same name.[1] Industrial Light &amp; Magic provided computer graphics and animatronics for the special effects.\nThe film stars Robin Williams as Alan, a man who emerges from the game's unseen jungle world, along with Kirsten Dunst as a girl who plays the game with her brother, David Alan Grier as a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer, Adam Hann-Byrd as Alan when he was a boy, Bonnie Hunt as the woman who played the game with Alan when they were children, and Jonathan Hyde in a dual role as both Alan's father and a hunter intent on killing Alan. The cast also features Bradley Pierce as the girl's brother and Bebe Neuwirth as her aunt. It was shot in Keene, New Hampshire, where the story is set, North Berwick, Maine (the Parrish Shoes factory) and Vancouver, British Columbia. In 2005, a spiritual sequel to Jumanji, Zathura, was released.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f948e2f9bd243b31383dff553893dfa37aee4847","amp;dn":"Jumanji","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f948e2f9bd243b31383dff553893dfa37aee4847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,72,226,249,189,36,59,49,56,61,255,85,56,147,223,163,122,238,72,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
