In 2004, Rian was replaced by another female vocalist, Wendy Yanko. In 2005, Flesh Field performed at the M'era Luna Festival in Hildesheim, Germany. Their 2004 album Strain peaked at number 4 on the 2005 DAC, charting for 8 weeks.\nIn January 2011, Ian Ross pronounced the retirement of Flesh Field as a musical project. Ian went on to further say that he will continue to make music, and that he is considering a new project. Seven of the instrumentals for &quot;Tyranny of the Majority&quot; were released on the official Flesh Field website mastered along with two additional untitled instrumentals that were cut from the album. Two of the album's tracks, &quot;Swarm&quot; and &quot;Forgotten Trauma&quot; can be found on the albums, &quot;Dependence: Next Level Electronics: Volume 2&quot; and &quot;Septic VI&quot; respectively.\n\n                                   Members\n\nIan Ross - All Music, Lyrics, Vocals\nWendy Yanko - Vocals\nScott Tron/Matthias Ewald - Keyboards (live performances only)\nJosh Creamer - Guitar (live performances only)\n\n\n\nTechnical\n12 tracks\nTRT: 01:03:46\nMP3 Format\n86.6MB\n\nPlease Seed\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c4f776e913cb5904b5085cd4c8dbc1ea9fb24bf","amp;dn":"Flesh+Field-Belief+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c4f776e913cb5904b5085cd4c8dbc1ea9fb24bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,79,119,110,145,60,181,144,75,80,133,205,76,141,188,30,169,251,36,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
