This is Chapter one. It is written by me and made only for the torrent world. You will not find this as a published book but only as an independent effort for torrenting. Please do seed this, and once it has enough seeds I will do Chapter 2. It is .pdf format, and is 46.1kb. It has 4 peoples perspective on the infestation of Day one April 2nd 2014. Comments are welcome and appreciated. It is a bit gory and has cussing as any good zombie novel should. Enjoy!\nhorrorhound\nSide note : The police dispatch call may look a bit off as the pdf locked it in a weird layout.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16d8f6372fad6dcc80d9c6022cb4ce2053fcc205","amp;dn":"Grassroots+of+the+Apocalypse+by+horrorhound+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16d8f6372fad6dcc80d9c6022cb4ce2053fcc205","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,216,246,55,47,173,109,204,128,217,198,2,44,180,206,32,83,252,194,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
