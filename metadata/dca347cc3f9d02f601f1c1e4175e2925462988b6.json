Thomas - Old Time Black Southern String Band Music (Arhoolie) [FLAC] {MKOP}\n\nLouisiana fiddle and guitar duo Butch Cage and Willie B. Thomas were recorded in 1959 by folklorist Harry Oster, who sought to capture a record of the fast-vanishing tradition of string bands who played dance and worship music for parties and church services. Primitive-sounding yet compelling, Cage and Thomas's versions of rarely heard ancient country blues songs like &quot;I Had a Dream Last Night&quot; and &quot;It Ain't Gonna Rain No More&quot; are a window into a bygone age, while their performance of &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; brings to light a song that, like the blues itself, has been constantly evolving for generations. ~Rovi (Allmusic)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t heard this driving, raucous, almost free-form black country dance music, then I envy you for the treat you will experienceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not all blues; thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gospel, ragtime, country dance tunes and popular song, but the blender that Cage and Thomas put these genres through gives them a unique flavor that belongs to the rural community they lived in and served as musicians.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ~Paul Vernon (Folk Roots)\n\n01.
