Each man is an acknowledged authority on his respective view of the end times. Thomas Ice is an ardent dispensationalist and co-author of several books with Tim LaHaye, author of The Left behind series. He also is a co-founder with LaHaye of the Pre-Trib Rapture Center, and is one of the editors of Tim LaHaye's Prophecy Study Bible. Gary DeMar is a prolific writer, Gary has authored over twenty books covering a full range of topics: Gary has been interviewed by Time magazine, CNN, MSNBC, FOX, the BBC, and Sean Hannity. He has done numerous radio and television interviews, including the &quot;Bible Answer Man,&quot; hosted by Hank Hanegraaff. Until now, no one of high visibility and with the educational credentials has challenged the end-times speculations of popular dispensationalist teachings like the ones that come forth from Tim LaHaye, Hal Lindsey, Jack Van Impe, Thomas Ice, and others. \n\nThis debate (The Great Tribulation: Past or Future?) between Thomas Ice (futurist) and Gary DeMar (preterist) took place during the 2006 American Vision Worldview Conference. Thomas Ice made this challenge just a few weeks after writing an article which referenced Tim Martin and Beyond Creation Science (2005). This public event shows how futurist/young earth writers will use their global flood views against preterism.\n\nThomas Ice raised the issue of the inconsistency between preterism and young-earth creationist beliefs a couple of times during the debate. His challenge came during his closing statement:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“What [young-earth] creationism teaches us is that the God of the Bible intervenes on a global scale. The apostle Peter clearly reminds us that just as God intervened globally at the flood, he will intervene globally at the Second Coming. Sadly, DeMarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s naturalistic approach to eschatology does not fit the biblical paradigm of divine intervention on a global scale. This is a matter of consistency. If one holds to a supernatural view of past history then one ought to hold to a supernatural view of future history as I have presented here tonightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ When one interprets the Olivet Discourse naturally, as Christ intended, it results in the realization that the Great Tribulation is future to our dayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ On the other hand, if you agree with Gary that it is a past event, then you stand the meaning of ChristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teaching on its head based upon Ã¢â‚¬Å“this generation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my challenge, Gary. Either adopt an old-earth, local-flood view of Genesis that fits with your preterist eschatology or adopt a supernatural futurist view of eschatology that fits with a young-earth global-flood view, thank you.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\n    - Dr. Thomas Ice, Executive Director, Pretrib Research Center  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://beyondcreationscience.com/index.php?pr=Ice_Challenges_DeMar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://beyondcreationscience.com/index.php?pr=Ice_Challenges_DeMar&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d60bcdff1c5a578f33b244aa7d4cca122ab4b0a","amp;dn":"The+Great+Tribulation%3A+Past+Or+Future%3F+%282006%29+Divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d60bcdff1c5a578f33b244aa7d4cca122ab4b0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,96,188,223,241,197,165,120,243,59,36,74,167,212,204,161,34,171,75,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
