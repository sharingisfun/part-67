I have seen many people using several anti-virus and other tools running. So I decided to start creating a hosts database of badware and malware. Which means a complete list of bad websites including phishing, scam, malware and everything else. After that I developed this, a great tool to manage it and keep it updated. I have implemented some nice other features like system cleanup and DropLab. So how does it work? Well it uses your hosts file to block connections to the bad websites and hosts. That's why we can call this tool a kernel-level protection tool. It does not require additional services for the protection module. This tool doesn't use much CPU power and very less Memory consuming. Note that this is not a anti-virus replacement.\n\nHow To Use:\nClick On &quot;Defendos&quot;.\nMove folder named 'Defendos v1.0.0' on desktop\nOpen 'defendos.exe'\nClick Serials\nChoose A  'Serial'.\nRegister 'Defendos'.\nEnjoy!!\n\nSupport thread: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thumperdc.com/forum/defendos-v1-0-0-t70313.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thumperdc.com/forum/defendos-v1-0-0-t70313.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nscreen: &lt;a href=&quot; http://leetleech.org/images/08472426728669712193.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://leetleech.org/images/08472426728669712193.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n====================================================================================\nNote: If You Have Problem With Any Of my Torrents Register To My Site And PM Me About Your  Problem: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thumperdc.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thumperdc.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n====================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80208599ddb81dc327c02c0111c259076dc2034a","amp;dn":"Defendos+v1.0.0+Incl.+Serial+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80208599ddb81dc327c02c0111c259076dc2034a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,32,133,153,221,184,29,195,39,192,44,1,17,194,89,7,109,194,3,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
