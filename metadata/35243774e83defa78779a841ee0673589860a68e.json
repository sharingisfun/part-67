The two computers don't even have to be the same type, so for example you can use VNC to view a Windows Vista desktop at the office on a Linux or Mac computer at home. For ultimate simplicity, there is even a Java viewer, so that any desktop can be controlled remotely from within a browser without having to install software.\n\nVNC is in widespread active use by many millions throughout industry, academia and privately. There are several versions to choose from, including a free version and some substantially enhanced commercial versions.\n\nYou can read more about how VNC can be used here: http://www.realvnc.com/vnc/how.html\n\n\nVNCÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Enterprise Edition is a much enhanced version of VNC, developed for use in enterprises of all sizes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35243774e83defa78779a841ee0673589860a68e","amp;dn":"RealVNC+Enterprise+4.6.0.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35243774e83defa78779a841ee0673589860a68e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,36,55,116,232,61,239,167,135,121,168,65,238,6,115,88,152,96,166,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
