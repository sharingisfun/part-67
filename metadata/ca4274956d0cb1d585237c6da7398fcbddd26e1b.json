The series also talks to family members whose loved ones where involved in the crash.\n \nEven though the media commonly refers to road crashes like these as accidents, the police do not for the reason that the word 'accident' suggests that it was no one's fault. The truth is that every crash has a cause or causes that are usually related to human factors. To quote the former head of the Waitemata SCU (the unit featured in the series): &quot;There is no such thing as an accident&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca4274956d0cb1d585237c6da7398fcbddd26e1b","amp;dn":"SCU.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca4274956d0cb1d585237c6da7398fcbddd26e1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,66,116,149,109,12,177,213,133,35,124,109,167,57,143,203,221,210,110,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
