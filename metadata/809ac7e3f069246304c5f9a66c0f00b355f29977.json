Standard antivirus programs are good at detecting this Malware, but not always good at effectively removing it. The majority of Anti-Malware Scanners are well able to detect malicious software - Trojan Horses, Internet Worms, Adware/Spyware etc. - but are not always efficient in removing them once they have been triggered.\n\nTrojan Remover is designed specifically to disable/remove Malware without the user having to manually edit system files or the Registry. The program also removes the additional system modifications some Malware carries out which are ignored by some standard antivirus scanners. Trojan Remover scans ALL the files loaded at boot time for Adware, Spyware, Remote Access Trojans, Internet Worms and other malware. Two types are available.\nThe Standard scan quickly scans the system with no need for further configuration of the scan parameters.The Custom scanÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ allows the user to select any of the folders for scan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:809ac7e3f069246304c5f9a66c0f00b355f29977","amp;dn":"Loaris+Trojan+Remover+1.2.5.4+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"809ac7e3f069246304c5f9a66c0f00b355f29977","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,154,199,227,240,105,36,99,4,197,249,166,108,15,0,179,85,242,153,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
