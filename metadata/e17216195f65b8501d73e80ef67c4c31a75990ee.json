This reporter thought that he could see the feathers flying from their mouths and that this to him was evidence that it didn't matter which party won because financially it would still be business as usual.\n\n \nI'm feeling slightly sad for all the NESARA people who worked so hard to bring\nabout change within our government, and now they're swallowing a very bitter\npill, while a Harvard-trained, &quot;man of the system&quot; is sailing in and reaping the\nrewards of their hard work.  Go figure it out yourself.\n \nWith regard to David Icke, I never did &quot;get&quot; him and his spiel.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e17216195f65b8501d73e80ef67c4c31a75990ee","amp;dn":"Barack+Obama+-+The+Naked+Emperor+by+By+David+Icke.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e17216195f65b8501d73e80ef67c4c31a75990ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,114,22,25,95,101,184,80,29,115,232,14,246,124,76,49,167,89,144,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
