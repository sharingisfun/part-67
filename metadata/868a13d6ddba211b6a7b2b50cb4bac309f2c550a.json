Developing the new time theory enabled controlling its existing form. The world has changed thanks to that!

Thanks to the minerals obtained during the explorations of other planets, the technological development continues to pick up pace.\n15 years later, at the beginning of 2036 after intercepting an unusual signal from an unknown civilization, the EIA Ministry assigned all its financial and logistic resources in order to make another contact..\n\nUnfortunately, the Xelorians turned out to be uninterested in the diplomatic contact with humans and the only activity which they were willing to take towards human beings was to begin military action.\n\nWhat's in this version: (Updated : Jul 22,2 012)\n\n    Red Baron Episode is unlocked\n    New powerups\n    New weapons\n    Bug fixes\n    ICS menu bar is now fixed\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.1+\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:868a13d6ddba211b6a7b2b50cb4bac309f2c550a","amp;dn":"Xelorians+-+Space+Shooter+v1.2.0+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"868a13d6ddba211b6a7b2b50cb4bac309f2c550a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,138,19,214,221,186,33,27,106,123,43,80,203,75,172,48,159,44,85,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
