One thing is known - these beautiful creatures are under threat and their numbers are dwindling steadily. Something has to be done to save these exotic creatures that live in some of the world's warmest oceans. That something is happening in, of all places, Ireland.\nThe Seahorse Man is the fascinating, heartbreaking but ultimately hope-affirming story of the charismatic Irish marine biologist Kealan Doyle and his dogged attempt to save an extraordinary species from extinction. Filmed on location in Connemara, Dublin, China and Indonesia, this is a business story with a decided twist - despite his lack of commercial experience, Doyle emerges as a uniquely driven individual. He started up Seahorse Ireland, an extraordinary company founded in the least likely location - a backwater fishing village that Doyle and his team envisage as the future seahorse capital of the world.\n\n\n1)  Seahorsemen \nThe first programme in this four part series traces the startup of Seahorse Ireland - an extraordinary company founded in the least likely location - a backwater fishing village which they envisage as the future seahorse capital of the world. Spanning the company's first two years in business, we follow Doyle and Maher as they struggle to perfect the breeding process, eventually attracting a host of innovation awards and huge media attention in the summer of 2003.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/1329/theseahorsemanscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/1329/theseahorsemanscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/6425/theseahorsemanscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/6425/theseahorsemanscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img253.imageshack.us/img253/5135/theseahorsemanscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img253.imageshack.us/img253/5135/theseahorsemanscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/9335/theseahorsemanscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/9335/theseahorsemanscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img152.imageshack.us/img152/2827/theseahorsemanscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img152.imageshack.us/img152/2827/theseahorsemanscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/4412/theseahorsemanscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/4412/theseahorsemanscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4598/theseahorsemanscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4598/theseahorsemanscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/9499/theseahorsemanscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/9499/theseahorsemanscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/4694/theseahorsemanscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/4694/theseahorsemanscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1778 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 25mins (Extra = 46mins)\n * Number Of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: Parts 350 MB (Extra = 746 MB)\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seahorse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seahorse&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6750deea1a1add7954e2d13ee1471490d7c9bc6a","amp;dn":"The+Seahorse+Man+1of4+Seahorsemen+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6750deea1a1add7954e2d13ee1471490d7c9bc6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,80,222,234,26,26,221,121,84,226,209,62,225,71,20,144,215,201,188,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
