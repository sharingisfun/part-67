An opportunistic Austrian immigrant driven by curiosity and a desire to make it as a Hollywood actress in the early years of World War II, Hedy worked with avant-garde composer George Antheil to create the technology that we depend upon today for cell phones and GPS: frequency hopping. Though Richard Rhodes presents details about everyone involved in the separate experiences that the two inventors drew upon to make their breakthrough in HedyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Folly, the invention itself takes center stage, driving the remarkable story with precision. Rhodes skillfully weaves together all the disparate parts of the story, from how Hedy learned about Nazi torpedoes to why GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knowledge of player pianos was key to the invention, in order to create a highly readable genesis of the technology that influences billions of lives every day.\n\n\n\n\n&quot;This is a smart, strange and fascinating book, which deserves to find an audience.... Rhodes is particularly good when describing intellectual milieus, whether Vienna in the first years of the 20th century, the Paris of James Joyce, Ezra Pound and Sylvia Beach and Ã¢â‚¬â€ for that matter Ã¢â‚¬â€ the permanent bureaucracy of the Pentagon. Many will have forgotten the brutal Soviet attack on Finland in 1940, but Rhodes sums it up poignantly and succinctly in three pages about the death of AntheilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brother Henry. Finally, Rhodes is one of those few writers capable of explaining complicated scientific ideas to the general public, invariably with clarity and precision and sometimes wit and poetry as well.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Prof. Tim Page, Washington Post\n\n\n&quot;In Hedy's Folly, Rhodes weaves a fascinating...account of Lamarr's journey into scientific exploration and the political machinations of war, mixing thorough techno research with Hollywood glam.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Bill Deskowitz, USA Today\n\n\n&quot;Hedy Lamarr, Hollywood starlet and inventor of a torpedo guidance system during World War II? Who knew? Richard Rhodes, the Pulitzer-winning author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb, drops quite a bombshell with this revelation in his new book.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Weekend Picks, USA Today\n\n\n&quot;Richard Rhodes...unites the social history of Vienna, the classic era of Hollywood film, Paris in the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢20s, experimental music, weapons design, the niceties of patent law and the technology of information transmission Ã¢â‚¬â€ a real grab bag of elements Ã¢â‚¬â€ in this short, charming and remarkably seamless book. He makes a rigorous effort to establish exactly what Lamarr contributed.... 'She deserved better,' Rhodes writes, than to be judged by that spectacular face alone, and now, at last, she is.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Laura Miller, Salon\n\nUploader bloody loved this book. 64kbps.
