I liked the format of the Original Blitzkrieg. Barbarossa and Kursk are MUCH harder. So I made a custom file to make them play more like the Original Blitzkrieg. If anyone feels like me and likes the original gameplay let me know and I will upload Barbarossa and Kursk with my mod already installed in the game.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf1baf362a0d2666bcafefe6191ded3e0b22c285","amp;dn":"Map+Textures%2C+Unit+Skins%2C+and+new+units+for+Blitzkrieg+Series+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf1baf362a0d2666bcafefe6191ded3e0b22c285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,27,175,54,42,13,38,102,188,175,239,230,25,29,237,62,11,34,194,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
