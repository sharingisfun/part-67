Three additional installments were filmed two years later, with a sixth episode added in 1995. A further three documentaries were added in 2003.\n\n    &quot;The Coup D'Etat&quot; (1988)\n    &quot;The Forces Of Darkness&quot; (1988)\n    &quot;The Cover-Up&quot; (1991)\n    &quot;The Patsy&quot; (1991)\n    &quot;The Witnesses&quot; (1991)\n    &quot;The Truth Shall Set You Free&quot; (1995)\n    &quot;The Smoking Guns&quot; (2003)\n    &quot;The Love Affair&quot; (2003)\n    &quot;The Guilty Men&quot; (2003)\n\nMore info https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Killed_Kennedy (spoiler alert!)\n\nThis is not my torrent - I had downloaded it ages ago and think it is an important film that needs to be shared. Sorry for the lack of technical specs, but IMO the audio and video quality are great. In fact this is the first torrent I have uploaded. Watch this space for more in a similar vein.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:348e1e7d7e084b0b38cfdcc858e67cd6b2205095","amp;dn":"THE+MEN+WHO+KILLED+KENNEDY+-+DVDRIP+%5BAVI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"348e1e7d7e084b0b38cfdcc858e67cd6b2205095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,142,30,125,126,8,75,11,56,207,220,200,88,230,124,214,178,32,80,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
