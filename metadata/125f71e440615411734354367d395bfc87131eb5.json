In 1987 he took over leadership of an existing rebel group and renamed it the LordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Resistance Army (LRA).\n\nThe LRA has earned a reputation for its cruel and brutal tactics. When Joseph Kony found himself running out of fighters, he started abducting children to be soldiers in his army or Ã¢â‚¬Å“wivesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for his officers. The LRA is encouraged to rape, mutilate, and kill civiliansÃ¢â‚¬â€œoften with blunt weapons.\n\nThe LRA is no longer active in northern Uganda (where it originated) but it continues its campaign of violence in Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, and South Sudan. In its 26-year history, the LRA has abducted more than 30,000 children and displaced at least 2.1 million people.\n\nInvisible ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s KONY 2012 campaign aims to make Joseph Kony famous, not to celebrate him, but to raise support for his arrest and set a precedent for international justice. In this case, notoriety translates to public support. If people know about the crimes that Kony has been committing for 26 years, they will unite to stop him.\n\nSecondly, we want Kony to be famous so that when he is stopped, he will be a visible, concrete example of international justice. Then other war criminals will know that their mass atrocities will not go unnoticed or unpunished.&quot;\n\n=========================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:125f71e440615411734354367d395bfc87131eb5","amp;dn":"Kony.2012+-+Arabic+Subs+Hardcoded","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"125f71e440615411734354367d395bfc87131eb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,95,113,228,64,97,84,17,115,67,84,54,125,57,91,252,135,19,30,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
