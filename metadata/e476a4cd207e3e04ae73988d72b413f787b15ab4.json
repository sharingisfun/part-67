The legendary Music City Records of Berkeley, California was one of the longest-lived, most fiercely independent black-owned record companies of the era. Over the course of two decades, owner Ray Dobard's release schedule reflected the evolution of black popular music, from smooth blues in the early 1950s, through R&amp;B, instrumentals, rock 'n' roll through to the end of the decade, proto-soul in the early 60s and into funk and modern soul in the 1970s. But it is the rich seam of Bay Area vocal groups that Music City mined, that collectors associate with the label. Dobard had only a couple of minor hits - the Four Deuces' popular W-P-L-J, Johnny Heartsman's raucous Johnny's House Party - but released over fifty 45 rpm singles and taped much, much more. The Music City Story is an unprecedented survey of the label's riches, the tapes to which have miraculously survived to provide an intimate portrait of this unique operation. The 3-disc set acts as an excellent primer for Ace's forthcoming genre-and artist-based compilations of Music City material, telling the story with both many rare gems from the catalogue, and a surfeit of previously unissued goodies. Among this set's 78 tracks are names familiar to doo wop and blues collectors - the Crescendos, Gaylarks, Rovers, 5 Lyrics, Alvin Smith etc - while behind several others lurk famous names (James Brown, Lou Rawls) or others soon to be famous (Sugar Pie Desanto, members of Sly &amp; The Family Stone). While Music City recorded many genres, from jazz to surf, the emphasis in The Music City Story is upon the black vocal group, be it 50s, 60s or 70s vintage.~Amazon\n\nMusic Keep On Playing*Thank You Seeders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e476a4cd207e3e04ae73988d72b413f787b15ab4","amp;dn":"The+Music+City+Story%7E3CD+%28Ace%29+%5B320KB%5D+%7BMKOP%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e476a4cd207e3e04ae73988d72b413f787b15ab4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,118,164,205,32,126,62,4,174,115,152,141,114,180,19,247,135,177,90,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
