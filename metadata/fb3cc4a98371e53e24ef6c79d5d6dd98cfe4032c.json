Yet despite the fame and fortune that have come with his enormous success, Brock has shunned the media, choosing instead to remain intensely private about his life and his accomplishments.\n\nNow, for the first time, he tells his remarkable story in his own words, describing the journey from his South Dakota farmboy roots to becoming the most popular pay-per-view attraction in the world. From the small-town amateur wrestling where he honed his skills to taking on The Rock at SummerSlam, Brock discusses how his natural athletic talent combined with the dark side of the wrestling business to make him the youngest-ever WWE Champion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb3cc4a98371e53e24ef6c79d5d6dd98cfe4032c","amp;dn":"Brock+Lesnar+Death+Clutch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb3cc4a98371e53e24ef6c79d5d6dd98cfe4032c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,60,196,169,131,113,229,62,36,239,108,121,213,214,221,152,207,228,3,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
