One of the nascent faithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early initiates was a twenty-three-year-old Ohio farmer named Parley Pratt, the distant grandfather of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. In The Mormon People, religious historian Matthew Bowman peels back the curtain on more than 180 years of Mormon history and doctrine. He recounts the churchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s origin and development, explains how Mormonism came to be one of the fastest-growing religions in the world by the turn of twenty-first-century, and ably sets the scene for a 2012 presidential election that has the potential to mark a major turning point in the way this Ã¢â‚¬Å“all-AmericanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ faith is perceived by the wider American publicÃ¢â‚¬â€and internationally.\n\n Mormonism started as a radical movement, with a profoundly transformative vision of American society that was rooted in a form of Christian socialism. Over the ensuing centuries, Bowman demonstrates, that vision has evolvedÃ¢â‚¬â€and with it the esteem in which Mormons have been held in the eyes of their countrymen. Admired on the one hand as hardworking paragons of family values, Mormons have also been derided as oddballs and persecuted as polygamists, heretics, and zealots clad in Ã¢â‚¬Å“magic underwear.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Even today, the place of Mormonism in public life continues to generate heated debate on both sides of the political divide. Polls show widespread unease at the prospect of a Mormon president. Yet the faith has never been more popular. Today there are about 14 million Mormons in the world, fewer than half of whom live inside the United States. It is a church with a powerful sense of its own identity and an uneasy sense of its relationship with the main line of American culture. \n\nMormons will surely play an even greater role in American civic life in the years ahead. In such a time, The Mormon People comes as a vital addition to the corpus of American religious historyÃ¢â‚¬â€a frank and fair-minded demystification of a faith that remains a mystery for many.\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb1102781a952b4ce2ae4847a840410fa1462b83","amp;dn":"The+Mormon+People+The+Making+of+an+American+Faith.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb1102781a952b4ce2ae4847a840410fa1462b83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,17,2,120,26,149,43,76,226,174,72,71,168,64,65,15,161,70,43,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
