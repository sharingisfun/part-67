This is the story of Aung San Suu Kyi and her husband, Michael Aris. Despite distance, long separations, and a dangerously hostile regime, their love endures until the very end. A story of devotion and human understanding set against a background of political turmoil which continues today. THE LADY also is the story of the peaceful quest of the woman who is at the core of Burma's democracy movement. \n\n\n\nGreetings Realuploads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87145c75a5768e4607f59d8339b00a3c5f41f92e","amp;dn":"The+Lady+%28+Nordic+subs+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87145c75a5768e4607f59d8339b00a3c5f41f92e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,20,92,117,165,118,142,70,7,245,157,131,57,176,10,60,95,65,249,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
