Songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hush,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rose Garden,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Games People PlayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Birds of a FeatherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ might have established his credentials as a writer, but his session work with the likes of Bob Dylan on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blonde on BlondeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Aretha Franklin on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chain of FoolsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ solidified his reputation as a unique guitarist. His cross between Duane EddyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twangy guitar and George HarrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twangy sitar, prominent is so many of his recordings, has never been equaled. SouthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Southern perspective on the goings on in late 1960s America remains unique.\n \nRock, gospel, country and folk strains are woven through his work. You hear echoes of Chuck Berry, Phil Spector, Dylan and a host of acid bands and many others in his work. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gabriel,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the finale of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Introspect,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the first and best of SouthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s albums, is DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Desolation Row on the verge of the Apocalypse put in the mouth of Southern street preacher.\n\nRegrettably, SouthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moment came and went all too soon. The meteor that swept across the pop and country music fields between 1968 and 1972 quickly disappeared from view. South dropped out of sight, was said to be living on Maui, and became as reclusive as another great talent, Fred Neil. The suicide of his brother in 1971  is said to have been partly to blame. But whatever took him away, his absence  was pop and country musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loss.\n\nTo my knowledge, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Introspect,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ released in 1969, has never been available as a CD in the United States. I can only find one digital issue of the set, on a CD with another South album, which was released in Australia.  New copies of that are available at Amazon for upwards of $150 and used ones are $65. I guess that means I am not alone in valuing holding Ã¢â‚¬Å“IntrospectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in high esteem.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aa0613a53215687a41b6a9f7056d757db874bb2","amp;dn":"Joe+South+-+Introspect+%281969%29+WAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aa0613a53215687a41b6a9f7056d757db874bb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,160,97,58,83,33,86,135,164,27,106,159,112,86,215,87,219,135,75,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
