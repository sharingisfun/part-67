It was written as a tribute to Roger Zelazny, and inspired by his novel A Night in the Lonesome October.\n\nWritten by Neil Gaiman\nAdapted by Troy Nixey\nArt by P. Craig Russell\nColoring by Matthew Hollingsworth\n\nThe first presentation is the original b&amp;w Oni Double Features from 1998, issues 6-8, scanned and compiled as one book in the cbr format. This is my preferred version as I think the colored release takes away some of the details in P. Craig Russels' art.\n\nThe second presentation, which is included at the end of the b&amp;w ODF cbr file, is an original, unadapted text version with b&amp;w statue &quot;illustrations&quot; that Neil allowed to be printed to benefit the CBLDF. I have one of those so I scanned it and attached it at the end of the comic.\n\nThe third presentation is the reprinted, colored version from the year 2000, also by Oni Press.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc39d0894701bd7554db7bc46a3212b3972f0a8a","amp;dn":"Neil+Gaiman+-+Only+The+End+of+the+World+Again+%28X3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc39d0894701bd7554db7bc46a3212b3972f0a8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,57,208,137,71,1,189,117,84,219,123,196,106,50,18,179,151,47,10,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
