If anybody would like any of that other stuff and you're unable to download, just drop a comment and I'll seed it up.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCan't Get No is a graphic novel by Rick Veitch which concerns businessman Chad Roe's depression after the financial collapse of his business, his seemingly permanent full-body marker tattoos, and the September 11 attacks, which prompt Roe to take a road trip.\n\nCan't Get No is unique for not only having no speech balloons, but for having captions only loosely related to the narrative. Most of the writing is, in fact, a long-verse poem that runs parallel to Roe's journey.\n\nAnother unique point of Can't Get No is the unusual shape of book, which wider than it is tall, creating a long landscape-style canvas that in turn affects the shape of the panels.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f484cb2509e289d7305558974ed49a214775562d","amp;dn":"Rick+Veitch+-+Can%27t+Get+No+%28Vertigo%29+%28GN%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f484cb2509e289d7305558974ed49a214775562d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,132,203,37,9,226,137,215,48,85,88,151,78,212,154,33,71,117,86,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
