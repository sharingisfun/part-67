The struggle to control both her creative and personal life is central to Janet's \ndevelopment as an artist and key to understanding her story - from escaping the clutches of her \noverbearing father to the thirst for new challenges in her groundbreaking collaborations with \nproducers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Dubbed the 'Queen of Radio' in America, she always seemed \ncapable of maintaining her broad-base appeal - until the infamous 2004 American Super Bowl \nappearance alongside Justin Timberlake.\n\nFeaturing an exclusive interview with Janet Jackson and contributions from the likes of Jimmy Jam \nJanet's brother Jackie Jackson, actor Deborah Allen and British pop talent Estelle..\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/m/HIHOW.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/m/HIHOW.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCredits\n\nDirector:Marina Warsama\n\nProducer:Marina Warsama\n\nExecutive Producer:Gethin Scourfield\n\nExecutive Producer:Paul Bullock\n\n\n59mn 01s | 585 MiB | 720x400 | 1387 Kbps | 25.000 fps | AAC | 128 Kbps Vbr | 2 ch | QF 0.181","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be53f7fcce47bf8978fd8347ac1f1330465dda55","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Janet+Jackson+Taking+Control+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be53f7fcce47bf8978fd8347ac1f1330465dda55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,83,247,252,206,71,191,137,120,253,131,71,172,31,19,48,70,93,218,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
