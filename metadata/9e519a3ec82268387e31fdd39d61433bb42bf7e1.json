Every beginning engineer needs a mentor to teach them the things that aren't taught in engineering school, but often lacks such a guide. This book fills that gap between theory and practice. Written by an expert electronics engineer who enjoys teaching the practical side of engineering, it covers all the subjects that a beginning EE needs to know: intuitive circuit and signal analysis, physical equivalents of electrical components, proper use of an oscilloscope, troubleshooting both digital and analog circuits, and much more.\n\n*Covers the engineering basics that have been either left out of a typical engineer's education or forgotten over time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e519a3ec82268387e31fdd39d61433bb42bf7e1","amp;dn":"Electrical+Engineering-Darren-%28It+Covers+Basic+Compulsory+Downlo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e519a3ec82268387e31fdd39d61433bb42bf7e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,81,154,62,200,34,104,56,126,49,253,211,157,97,67,59,180,43,247,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
