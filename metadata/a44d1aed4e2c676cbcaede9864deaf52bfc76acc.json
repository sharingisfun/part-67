As we move away from traditional disk-based analysis into the interconnectivity of the cloud, Sherri and Jonathan have created a framework and roadmap that will act as a seminal work in this developing field.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Dr. Craig S. Wright (GSE), Asia Pacific Director at Global Institute for Cyber Security + Research.\n\n \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like a symphony meeting an encyclopedia meeting a spy novel.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œMichael Ford, Corero Network Security\n\n \n\nOn the Internet, every action leaves a markÃ¢â‚¬â€œin routers, firewalls, web proxies, and within network traffic itself. When a hacker breaks into a bank, or an insider smuggles secrets to a competitor, evidence of the crime is always left behind.\n\n \n\nLearn to recognize hackersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tracks and uncover network-based evidence in Network Forensics: Tracking Hackers through Cyberspace.Carve suspicious email attachments from packet captures. Use flow records to track an intruder as he pivots through the network. Analyze a real-world wireless encryption-cracking attack (and then crack the key yourself). Reconstruct a suspectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s web surfing historyÃ¢â‚¬â€œand cached web pages, tooÃ¢â‚¬â€œfrom a web proxy. Uncover DNS-tunneled traffic. Dissect the Operation Aurora exploit, caught on the wire.\n\n \n\nThroughout the text, step-by-step case studies guide you through the analysis of network-based evidence. You can download the evidence files from the authorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ web site (lmgsecurity.com), and follow along to gain hands-on experience.\n\n \n\nHackers leave footprints all across the Internet. Can you find their tracks and solve the case? Pick up Network Forensicsand find out.\n\n \n\n# Hardcover: 576 pages\n# Publisher: Prentice Hall; 1 edition (June 23, 2012)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0132564718\n# ISBN-13: 978-0132564717","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a44d1aed4e2c676cbcaede9864deaf52bfc76acc","amp;dn":"Network+Forensics-Tracking+Hackers+Through+Cyberspace+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a44d1aed4e2c676cbcaede9864deaf52bfc76acc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,77,26,237,78,44,103,108,188,174,222,152,100,222,175,82,191,199,106,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
