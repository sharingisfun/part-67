Of interest, the c2c version has a preview for Millar and Quietely's upcoming new series [i]Jupiter's Children[/i].\n*Note: You can download both or only choose which version you'd prefer by deselecting the one you don't want when you add the torrent to your client software.\n========================================================\n\n\nThe Supercrooks are raiding The Bastard's mansion, but everything goes horribly wrong. The Bastard - the world's greatest super-villain and 4th richest man on the planet - discovers that the Supercrooks are out to steal every cent he's ever made. Group leaders Johnny and Kasey fight and split up. The heist is complex, but the reward is enormous-and if the Supercrooks can survive, it will mean the end of The Heat's debts back in Vegas... not to mention an enormous payday.\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8ae0a5f108e2af662edb65b6a7cf4d9c55fa7cc","amp;dn":"Supercrooks+04+%28c2c+%26amp%3B+noAds%29+%28theProletariat-DCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8ae0a5f108e2af662edb65b6a7cf4d9c55fa7cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,174,10,95,16,142,42,246,98,237,182,91,106,124,244,217,197,95,167,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
