However, when one assassin, Carver (Gooding) takes a job with a gang he was once hired to eliminate, it launches into an all-out mob war where survival is about as certain as the number of bullets left in the clip. To make things worse, another assassin (Lundgren) has been hired to take out Carver and the result will make the streets run red. As Carver battles with his inner demons as well as his very real enemies, One in the Chamber doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let up until the very last man goes down. \n\nGenre: Action | Crime | Thriller \nIMDB rating: 3.4/10 \nDirected by: William Kaufman \nStarring: Dolph Lundgren, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Leo Gregory \n\nRelease Name: One.In.The.Chamber.2012.DVDRip.XviD-DiSPOSABLE \nSize: 700 MiB \nVideo: XviD, 640Ãƒâ€”352, 935 kbps \nAudio: English, MP3, 128kbps \nRuntime: 91 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:061f92dca3c596e05dd6f0707bae0c03a1e73dd3","amp;dn":"One+In+The+Chamber+2012+DVDRip+XviD-DiSPOSABLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"061f92dca3c596e05dd6f0707bae0c03a1e73dd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,31,146,220,163,197,150,224,93,214,240,112,123,174,12,3,161,231,61,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
