But they're the same generals we know in name only: their appearance, personality, and gender are all different. One day, first Oda Nobunaga and then all the others are transported to our world. Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c195cfa0f262e6dcef4ed0b9dc2a02ebc42aca1","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+23+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c195cfa0f262e6dcef4ed0b9dc2a02ebc42aca1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,25,92,250,15,38,46,109,206,244,237,11,157,194,160,46,188,66,172,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
