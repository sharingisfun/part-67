It's posted here, seemingly at random, due to it's connection to Mister E (he appears in this mini-series). Should you wish to download the other Books of Magic comic books they are presently available within other, larger torrents (such as the Books of Magic, Neil Gaiman or Sandman torrents).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f361380b594caa23e60b7064dedbd6519f5b2afe","amp;dn":"The+Books+of+Magic+-+The+Names+of+Magic+%28Vertigo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f361380b594caa23e60b7064dedbd6519f5b2afe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,97,56,11,89,76,170,35,230,11,112,100,222,219,214,81,159,91,42,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
