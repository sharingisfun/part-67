This 1999 studio recording is a collection of dance tunes played by six New Hampshire groups. Built upon a blend of English, French, and Celtic influences, the music features fiddle, guitar, flute, piano, mandolin, and hammered dulcimer. Some of New Hampshire's renowned dance callers invite you to &quot;choose your partners&quot; and join in New England contra dancing, barn dancing, and singing squares. Produced in collaboration with the New Hampshire State Council on the Arts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2eb1313f1e9f26d6f9558ac0e193b01f198ec97e","amp;dn":"Choose+Your+Partners+-+Contra+%26amp%3B+Square+Dance+Music+Of+New+Ha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2eb1313f1e9f26d6f9558ac0e193b01f198ec97e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,177,49,63,30,159,38,214,249,85,138,192,225,147,176,31,25,142,201,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
