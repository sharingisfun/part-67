He has no experience with either until he lets his cleaning lady (delectable Essex-girl Lisa) into his life, but he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bank on her vile boyfriend Denny or con-artists Simon and Ray stealing a two million quid nest egg from the boot of his car. Charles hunts them down across the Cote dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Azur whilst pursued by his rival Clancy who is incensed by the fact that Charles might actually be retiring.\n\nGenre: Comedy | Crime | Thriller \nIMDB Rating: N/A \nDirected by: Kris McManus \nStarring: Celia Muir, Darren Bransford and Lee Cheney \n\nRelease Name: Dead.In.France.2012.DVDRip.XviD-FiCO \nSize: 700 MB \nVideo: XviD, 640Ãƒâ€”272, 1159 kb/s \nAudio: English, MP3, 128 kb/s \nRuntime: 84 min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71c90e25ba9e13d411b546234b2494b50e106f17","amp;dn":"Dead+In+France+2012+DVDRip+XviD-FiCO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71c90e25ba9e13d411b546234b2494b50e106f17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,201,14,37,186,158,19,212,17,181,70,35,75,36,148,181,14,16,111,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
