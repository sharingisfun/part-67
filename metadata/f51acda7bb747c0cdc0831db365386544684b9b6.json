It is her first running series starring the two characters Millicent Retrab (the girl with the map) and Markesh (travelling companion and muito-mysteriouso Alchemist) in their quest to try to escape from the world of Akaline, a plane inhabited by people, figments, shadows, demons, and dolls (all in the most literal sense of the words).\n\nThe world involves many SciFi aspects, such as alchemy and organic cyberkinetic dolls, as well as fantasy, such as dragons, talking animals, and magical apparitions. The world also seems to be multilingual (languages resembling if not being Japanese and Korean appear in art throughout the series).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f51acda7bb747c0cdc0831db365386544684b9b6","amp;dn":"Next+Exit+%28Slave+Labor+Graphics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f51acda7bb747c0cdc0831db365386544684b9b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,26,205,167,187,116,124,12,220,8,49,219,54,83,134,84,70,132,185,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
