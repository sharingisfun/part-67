Why did feminism fizzle? Why are so many of today's women freezing their faces and emotions in an orgy of plasticity? Is &quot;having it all&quot; just a cruel hoax? In this witty and wide-ranging book, Maureen Dowd looks at the state of the sexual union, raising bold questions and examining everything from economics and politics to pop culture and the &quot;why?&quot; of the Y chromosome. These new writings will delight her devoted readers - and anyone trying to sort out the chaos that occurs when sexes collide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50e54a17a4a607ee8d99b2fe213750b2722fa6c0","amp;dn":"Are+Men+Necessary+-+Maureen+Dowd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50e54a17a4a607ee8d99b2fe213750b2722fa6c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,229,74,23,164,166,7,238,141,153,178,254,33,55,80,178,114,47,166,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
