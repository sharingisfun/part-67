In the latter part of the last century, social movements became a permanent feature of modern democracies. The studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and workersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ protests of the 1960s have been followed by movements focusing on womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rights, ethnic identities, peace and environmental issues. This book draws on research and empirical work across the social sciences to address the key questions in this international field.\n\n In this new edition, the authors have updated all chapters with the most recent literature, and expanded on topics such as individual motivations, new media, public policies, and governance. The book has also been redesigned to a more user-friendly format. More than ever, Social Movements is the ideal introduction for students of social movements within social and political science.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b9b43d9e60689647bb45bf4866954ea40da92f8","amp;dn":"how+to+start+a+Social+Movements-+An+Introduction.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b9b43d9e60689647bb45bf4866954ea40da92f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,155,67,217,230,6,137,100,123,180,91,244,134,105,84,234,64,218,146,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
