What you'll notice (especially for headphones) is the transition from mono to stereo at the half way point. Specifically:\n\n@20:03 - you hear &quot;cut to black&quot;, it cuts to black and viola ... stereo returns.\n\nIf you are patient, I'm sure there will be a WEB-DL soon.\n\nUntil then ... this will have to do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a291d00513454ed377f8411f666d1c9156d522f0","amp;dn":"Covert.Affairs.S03E05...XVID.audioFIX.MP4SUX.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a291d00513454ed377f8411f666d1c9156d522f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,145,208,5,19,69,78,211,119,248,65,31,102,109,28,145,86,213,34,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
