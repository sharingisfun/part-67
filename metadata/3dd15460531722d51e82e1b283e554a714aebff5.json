Rather then let it install to the 'Program Files (x86)', erase the (x86). So the path would be 'c:Program FilesDVDFab 8 Qt (32-bit)'\nNote: I appended (32-bit) to the name so I would remember that it's a 32-bit app and not 64-bit.\n- From the first launch window of DVDFab, choose 'Patch or Crack'. A explorer window should pop up that points to 'C:UsersJoeAppDataLocalTempir_ext_temp_0AutoPlayDocsPatch And Crack'\n- Open the 'or Crack' folder.\n- Copy the 'msvcr90.dll' file to your 'c:Program FilesDVDFab 8 Qt (32-bit)' folder. Rename the original if needed.\n- Go back to your 'Patch and Crack' folder.\n- Open the 'DVDFab.Products.v8.x.x.x.Multi.Patch.v1.x-BBB' folder\n- Launch 'Patch'\n- Press the 'P' button.\n- Navigate to your 'c:Program FilesDVDFab 8 Qt (32-bit)' folder and select the 'msvcr90.dll' you copied over from earlier.\n- Click 'Open'\nThat should do it. Open DVDFab and verify that it says in the field &quot;License Expires&quot; it says &quot;Never Expires&quot; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dd15460531722d51e82e1b283e554a714aebff5","amp;dn":"DVDFab+Platinum+v8.1.6.7+Qt+Beta+%2B+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dd15460531722d51e82e1b283e554a714aebff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,209,84,96,83,23,34,213,30,130,225,178,131,229,84,167,20,174,191,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
