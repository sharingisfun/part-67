We're then brought hundreds of years into the past, through a forest of blossoming cherry trees, blossoms blowing in the wind, and breezes moving the branches as if breathing (unintended plentiful &quot;B&quot; use). It's easy to understand why they were feared, they seem mystical, powerful, and Shinoda presents them as a force. The plot is filled with a beautiful woman (Iwashita Shima, Shinoda's wife) bending a fairly unattractive, bloodthirsty and blustery man (Tomisaburo Wakayama, recognizable from Shinoda's Captive's Island a decade earlier) to her will. Many beheadings, murder, sexual perversion (I won't go into detail here, but there are some moments that will lead to serious eyebrow raising and head scratching), and ambitious city-dwelling fill the story. And falling right in line with the ghost story genre, you have your twist ending.\n\n\n__________________________________________\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : Blossoming.Cherry.Trees.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 701 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 34mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 034 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (MPEG)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 34mn\nBit rate                         : 865 Kbps\nWidth                            : 632 pixels\nHeight                           : 392 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.612\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.146\nStream size                      : 587 MiB (84%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.0.3 (UTC 2004-12-20)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 34mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 160 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 1 channel\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 109 MiB (15%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 504 ms\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f2dadf63dd8e53b13f732b65eaab9814d807137","amp;dn":"Under+the+Blossoming+Cherry+Trees+%28M.+Shinoda%2C+1975%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f2dadf63dd8e53b13f732b65eaab9814d807137","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,45,173,246,61,216,229,59,19,247,50,182,94,170,185,129,77,128,113,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
