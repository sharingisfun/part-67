It is a follow on from Humphries's 2011 comic series, Our Love is real. The story revolves around a girl named Heidi and a rogue soldier called Rex. Rex is present from the opening scene where he is falling from the sky onto an alternative earth which has been designated a &quot;junk&quot; world. He is introduced as being committed to a quest of vengeance against an unspecified opponent. Heidi is introduced as a tough young woman who so far has only known the &quot;junk&quot; earth, where garbage is continually falling out of the sky.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d3fe0d9f1f060d13554ac039a5f0672f8651602","amp;dn":"Higher+Earth+1-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d3fe0d9f1f060d13554ac039a5f0672f8651602","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,63,224,217,241,240,96,209,53,84,172,3,154,95,6,114,248,101,22,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
