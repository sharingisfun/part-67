Using this bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful Work/Life Approach, you can build that organization. World-renowned performance consultants Dr. Gene Fusch and Richard Gillespie offer a step-by-step blueprint for developing a true performance culture, where people bring a relentless focus and selfless collaboration to bear on the organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most fundamental goals. A Practical Approach to Performance Interventions and Analysis walks through every step of the process: analyzing business problems, identifying performance gaps, selecting the best interventions, measuring results, and more. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to integrate your organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s goals with the beliefs and needs of your people; foster unity without conformity, and diversity without division; how to overcome the fear and distrust that makes organizations dysfunctional; and how to build an organization where everyone really takes ownership of their Ã¢â‚¬Å“fraction of the action.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Along the way, they present 50 dynamic models that tightly connect theory to real-world business practice, are ROI-driven, are fully measurable, and can be utilized by all leaders and practitioners in HR, organizational development, and training. With their guidance, you can choose and execute the performance initiatives that deliver the greatest positive impact on culture, business metrics, and the lives of all your people.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 224 pages\n# Publisher: FT Press; 1 edition (May 24, 2012)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 013304050X\n# ISBN-13: 978-0133040500","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6895fa722cd4106ad428f93a10c79930f27aeed9","amp;dn":"A+Practical+Approach+to+Performance+Interventions+and+Analysis+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6895fa722cd4106ad428f93a10c79930f27aeed9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,149,250,114,44,212,16,106,212,40,249,58,16,199,153,48,242,122,238,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
