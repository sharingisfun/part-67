He was born into a family with at least five ordained ministers, including his father, Monty, a founding member of the Jordanaires.\n\nRandy's music and concert style has always pushed the envelope. In 1974, Randy was invited to perform at The Jesus Festival, a Woodstock type event in which attenders camped out and listened to Christian music and Bible teaching for three days. When Matthews' band took the stage, the promoters and many in the crowd were shocked at their rock and roll presentation; up to this point most contemporary Christian music was more influenced by folk than rock. Matthews' band was unplugged by the promoters and chased off the stage by the concert-goers. Randy referenced this experience on his fourth album, 1975's Eyes to the Sky, with a song called Pennsylvania song: &quot;you pulled the plug and drained my soul, but I know I left a ring around the tub of tradition, I saw some dance and sing&quot; and again in his ninth solo album, titled Plugged In.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - August 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e626b8edcf7750b79068036529b5512a56b5519b","amp;dn":"Randy+Matthews+Discography+1971-1990+%2811+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e626b8edcf7750b79068036529b5512a56b5519b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,38,184,237,207,119,80,183,144,104,3,101,41,181,81,42,86,181,81,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
