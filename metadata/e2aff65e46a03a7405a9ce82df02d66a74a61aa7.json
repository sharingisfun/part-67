The plications of archaeological evidence such as this could have an enormous impact on the scientific community as well as the religious community. The Gospel of Matthew may have been written by someone who actually witnessed events in life of\nJesus, a possible eyewitness to the last supper and perhaps even the crucifixion. Matthew D'Ancona of Magdelen College in Oxford travels from Egypt to the Holy Land in pursuit of the evidence that can prove that this papyrus was written during the life and times of Jesus. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?item_no=578921&amp;item_code=WW&amp;netp_id=875648&amp;event=ESRCN&amp;view=details&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?item_no=578921&amp;item_code=WW&amp;netp_id=875648&amp;event=ESRCN&amp;view=details&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2aff65e46a03a7405a9ce82df02d66a74a61aa7","amp;dn":"Eyewitness+sus+%282011%29+Divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2aff65e46a03a7405a9ce82df02d66a74a61aa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,175,246,94,70,160,58,116,5,169,206,130,223,2,214,106,116,166,26,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
