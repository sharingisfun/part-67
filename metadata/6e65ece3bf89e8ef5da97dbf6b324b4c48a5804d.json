And the Clocks Moved\n2. Cruel\n3. Run\n4. To Know You\n\n\n\nReview from Orlando Weekly:\n\nOrlando singer Ashley Dudukovich is many things on her band Chasing Jonah's debut EP: heart-shattered, afraid of love and &quot;walking down Mills Avenue&quot; after some car trouble, &quot;where early sunset leapt off and took flight.&quot; One thing she's not is a dummy. Although her front-and-center, delicately lilting voice rises and falls with seemingly every painful memory a lyric digs up ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ an undeniably voyeuristic pleasure ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ Chasing Jonah's tracks start slow, build to crescendos capably managed by her backing band and only realize their fullness at the peak pop moment, making this effort a demo sure to perk up the ears of the lovesick and licensing scouts alike.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e65ece3bf89e8ef5da97dbf6b324b4c48a5804d","amp;dn":"Chasing+Jonah+-+Debut+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e65ece3bf89e8ef5da97dbf6b324b4c48a5804d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,101,236,227,191,137,232,239,93,169,125,191,107,50,75,76,72,165,128,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
