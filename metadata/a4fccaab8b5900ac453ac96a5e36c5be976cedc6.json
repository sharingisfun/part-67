After Judas Priest's biography they performed &quot;Breaking the Law&quot;, &quot;The Green Manalishi (With The Two-Pronged Crown)&quot; and &quot;You've Got Another Thing Comin'.&quot;\nThe All-American Rejects then performed Def Leppard's &quot;Photograph&quot;. During the performance, drummer Chris Gaylor wore nothing but British flag shorts - a reference to what Leppard drummer Rick Allen wore in all the band's old music videos. After Def Leppard's biography they took the stage and performed &quot;Rock of Ages,&quot; a long version of &quot;Rocket&quot; with a guitar solo, then continued to play a T.Rex cover off their newest album, Yeah!, &quot;20th Century Boy.&quot; For this performance, Joe Elliott invited Brian May to join the band.\nA supergroup was then formed of Rob Zombie, Slash, Gilby Clarke, Scott Ian, Ace Frehley, and Tommy Lee. The six then performed &quot;God of Thunder&quot;. Kiss followed with their closing performance of &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;, &quot;Deuce&quot;, &quot;Love Gun&quot; and for encore they performed &quot;Makin' Love&quot;. This went against traditional Kiss performances as they normally closed with &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;.\n\nTrack list :\n\nVH1 Rock Honors intro\nFoo Fighters &amp; Queen - Tie Your Mother Down\nGodsmack - Judas Priest medley\nJudas Priest - Breakin' The Law\nJudas Priest - You Got Another Thing Comin'\nJudas Priest - The Green Manalishi (With The Two-Pronged Crown)\nAll-American Rejects - Photograph\nDef Leppard - Rock Of Ages\nDef Leppard - Rocket\nDef Leppard &amp; Brian May - 20th Century Boy\nRob Zombie, Slash, Gilby Clarke, Scott Ian, Ace Frehley, and Tommy Lee - God Of Thunder\nKiss - Detroit Rock City\nKiss - Deuce\nKiss - Love Gun\nEnd Of Show\n\nQuality: HDTVRip 1080i\nContainer:MKV\nVideo codec:H.264\nAudio codec:AC3\nVideo:H264 AVC, 1920x1080, ~17 Mbps, 30 fps\nAudio:AC3, 384 kbps, 48 kHz, stereo\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4fccaab8b5900ac453ac96a5e36c5be976cedc6","amp;dn":"VH1.+Rock+Honors+2006+HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4fccaab8b5900ac453ac96a5e36c5be976cedc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,252,202,171,139,89,0,172,69,58,201,106,94,54,197,190,151,108,237,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
