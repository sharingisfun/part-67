She shares deep and loving bond with his ailing grandfather (Kaifi Azmi) who represents the era of communal harmony between Hindus and Muslims in India, as he fondly recalls the times he spent in pre-Independent Agra. As communal tension erupts in the city of Bombay, Naseem get increasingly bewildered by changing dynamics at her school and in the neighbourhood, while her grandfather watches helplessly at a city getting deeply divided over the Babri Masjid issue. The film ends with the grandfather passing away on the day of demolition of Babri Masjid.\n\nNaseem is considered an important socio-political film that marks a turning point in the Hindu-Muslim dynamics in India as it is based around the Babri Masjid demolition of 1992. It stands amidst great films of this genre, like KA Abbas's Dharti Ke Lal (1946) and M. S. Satyu's Garam Hawa (1973).\n\nIt won the 1996 National Film Award for Best Screenplay for Saeed Akhtar Mirza and Ashok Mishra.\n\nCredits to Anantphy for uploading this masterpiece on tpb here :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7249026/Naseem_1995_Hindi_%28by_Anant%29_A_film_by_Saeed_Akhtar_Mirza&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7249026/Naseem_1995_Hindi_%28by_Anant%29_A_film_by_Saeed_Akhtar_Mirza&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis has been Encoded into small size and uploaded on request of snehit.\n\nCast:\nKaifi Azmi...Naseem's Grandfather\nMayuri Kango...Naseem\nKulbushan Kharbanda\nSurekha Sikri\nKay Kay Menon...Religious Fundamentalist\nSalim Shah...Mushtaq \n\nMedia Info :\nLanguage - Hindi (Indian)\nVideo Size - 515 MB\nVideo Codec - H.264/AVC\nVideo Res - 640 x 480\nVideo Frame Rate - 25 fps\nVideo Bitrate - 833 Kbps\nSubtitles - English Hardsubbed\nAudio Codec - MP3\nChannels - Stereo\nSample Rate - 44100 Hz @ 128 kbps\nLength - 1 Hour 26 mins\n\n\nScreens :\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/yB2yD.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/ebmGz.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/zgc3X.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/2EkFR.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/KEnPZ.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/eEYR3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Ao38A.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nTakes me 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 2 Hours to Upload &amp; Months to Seed\n\nTakes me 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\n\nTakes you just 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;.
