If you are looking for an application that provides hands-free operation of your phone to open apps, read and reply to text messages and email, schedule calendar events and many more functions that you can perform using just your voice then AVX is right for you.\n\nIf you are just looking for an electronic friend to chat with then please go with one of the Siri clones. On the other hand if you want a real virtual assistant that has useful functions that will make your life easier then please give AVX a try.\n\nAVX has all the functions you'd expect your assistant to perform plus some that you probably never new were possible. Here is a list of some of the functions that you wont find in most of the competition:\n\nFeatures:\n\n    Reading and replying to incoming text and email including Microsoft Exchange\n    Integration with Evernote\n    Home Automation with INSTEON. Turn on the lights and appliances, open the garage door and a whole lot more, all with voice commands or scheduled or based on your location.\n    Location based reminders. Remind you to do something based on your location.\n    Location based actions. Perform any function that AVX can do based on your current location. Have AVX automatically text your wife when you leave the office.\n\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Aug 28, 2012)\n\n    ANDROID 4.1\n    NOW READS YOUR TWITTER FEED (VIDEO)\n    SELECT CONTACT DEFAULT EMAIL AND NUMBERS\n    BLUETOOTH IMPROVEMENTS\n    NEW MESSAGING FEATURES (VIDEO)\n    INTEGRATION WITH TASKER (VIDEO)\n    QUICK START HELP MENU\n    HANDS-FREE READ AND REPLY TO FACEBOOK FEED (VIDEO)\n    SPEAK AND PROMPT MESSAGE MODE\n    IMPROVED SCREEN LOCK/WAKE WITH PROFILES\n    NEW SETTINGS PROFILES\n    EVERNOTE INTEGRATION\n    MICROSOFT EXCHANGE INTEGRATION\n    LOCATION BASED ACTIONS, REMINDERS\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.2+\n\n\n\n                              By bobiras2009\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a608987c5dfd43b571338bbb310dd13ead83df9","amp;dn":"Android+Voice+Xtreme+v2.34+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a608987c5dfd43b571338bbb310dd13ead83df9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,96,137,135,197,223,212,59,87,19,56,187,179,16,221,19,234,216,61,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
