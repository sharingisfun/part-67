It includes extensive use of natural heat flow methods, and the arrangement of building materials to direct heat from wherever we get it to wherever we want it, all without using machinery to make it work. With the rising cost of energy, all home builders should get familiar with basic PAHS principles.\n\nThe goal of Passive Annual Heat Storage is to provide a method of placing building materials and organizing construction so that the comfortable environments produced are continuously pleasant. The resulting subterranean home interiors are balanced with the natural environment, and are able to extract all of their energy needs from their surroundings without using any commercial energy sources. Thus, there is no longer any need for using mechanical devices or causing any disruption in global ecosystems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8df8249fa5106b13f1fd60226cc1e382e7346584","amp;dn":"PASSIVE+ANNUAL+HEAT+STORAGE%2C+IMPROVING+THE+DESIGN+OF+EARTH+SHELT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8df8249fa5106b13f1fd60226cc1e382e7346584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,248,36,159,165,16,107,19,241,253,96,34,108,193,227,130,231,52,101,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
