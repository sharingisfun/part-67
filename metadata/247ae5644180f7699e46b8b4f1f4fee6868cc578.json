During that time, Kele Okereke pursued a solo career and bassist Gordon Moakes formed the side project Young Legionnaire - in other words, the bandmembers had time to live their lives before returning to the fray, and it shows in how revitalized and vital Bloc Party sound on the album. Songs such as the lead single &quot;Octopus&quot; practically jump out of speakers with pent-up energy, recalling the angular thrust of the band's Silent Alarm era with an even poppier twist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:247ae5644180f7699e46b8b4f1f4fee6868cc578","amp;dn":"Bloc+Party+-+Four+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"247ae5644180f7699e46b8b4f1f4fee6868cc578","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,122,229,100,65,128,247,105,158,70,184,180,241,244,254,230,134,140,197,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
