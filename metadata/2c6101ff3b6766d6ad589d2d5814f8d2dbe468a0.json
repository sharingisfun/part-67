He plays the audio of the speech he delivered there, as well as the one by Anthony Gregory [Independent Institute, Future of Freedom Foundation, LewRockwell.com].\n\nScott's guest today is Mark Sheffield of PolicyOnPoint.com, whose most recent article there is &quot;How to Blow Up the World: EverymanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide to European Missile Defense.&quot;\n\nI usually divide Scott's shows on the points at which he takes a break and plays some music. Today, that would have resulted in a 54 minute segment followed by a 4:30 segment, followed by a couple of medium-length parts. Rather than that, I decided to just go with two 50 minute+ files.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c6101ff3b6766d6ad589d2d5814f8d2dbe468a0","amp;dn":"Scott+Horton+Show+-+2012+Aug+28+TU+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c6101ff3b6766d6ad589d2d5814f8d2dbe468a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,97,1,255,59,103,102,214,173,88,157,45,88,20,248,210,219,228,104,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
