Through examples of real-world applications, this hands-on guide introduces you to basic CV techniques for collecting, processing, and analyzing streaming digital images. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll then learn how to apply these methods with SimpleCV, using sample Python code. All you need to get started is a Windows, Mac, or Linux system, and a willingness to put CV to work in a variety of ways. Programming experience is optional.\n\n    * Capture images from several sources, including webcams, smartphones, and Kinect\n    * Filter image input so your application processes only necessary information\n    * Manipulate images by performing basic arithmetic on pixel values\n    * Use feature detection techniques to focus on interesting parts of an image\n    * Work with several features in a single image, using the NumPy and SciPy Python libraries\n    * Learn about optical flow to identify objects that change between two image frames\n    * Use SimpleCVÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s command line and code editor to run examples and test techniques \n\n\n# Paperback: 254 pages\n# Publisher: O'Reilly Media (August 9, 2012)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1449320368\n# ISBN-13: 978-1449320362","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c6b7e5165cb256e86b8cabb401b4a86a150704a","amp;dn":"Practical+Computer+Vision+w.+SimpleCV+%28Pdf%2FePUB%29+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c6b7e5165cb256e86b8cabb401b4a86a150704a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,107,126,81,101,203,37,110,134,184,202,187,64,27,74,134,161,80,112,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
