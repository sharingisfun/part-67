By the time of this landmark album, Dorothy had been knocking around the jazz world for a number of years, but it wasn't until she hooked up with Richard Evans at Cadet Records that her sound really began to cook -- breaking down genres and expectations in the trademark style of the best late 60s sides from the Chicago underground. The record's got a bit of funk, a bit of jazz, and a heck of a lot of soul -- and the setting works perfectly for Dorothy's harp, giving it a lot more room to work around than some of her smaller jazz combo albums. The album includes two great originals -- &quot;Soul Vibrations&quot; and &quot;Afro-Harping&quot; -- both of which have a nice funky edge, and a groovy soulful bounce -- and other tunes include &quot;Lonely Girl&quot;, &quot;Life Has Its Trials&quot;, &quot;Look Of Love&quot;, &quot;Come Live With Me&quot;, and a great version of Freddie Hubbard's &quot;Little Sunflower&quot;.
