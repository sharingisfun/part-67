End Of The Show  *\n\n\n*w/ David Blackmon on Fiddle\n\n**NOTE FROM DOOLY-WZMB - I DESPISE POSTING INCOMPLETE SHOWS!!!\n\n&quot;Send Your Mind&quot; was the first tune of Set 1.  &quot;Hope In a Hopeless \nWorld&quot; was the last tune of the show.  However, for some reason \nmy source never included either of them!  Despite the show opener \nAND closer missing, this is a STELLAR show and superb sound quality.  \n\nIF I can find those 2 missing tunes, I'll note the torrent and reseed \nit so you can download those 2 missing tunes. For WSP shows, it's VERY \ndifficult these days to get SBD's unless WSP posts them for download \non their site, which are not too many &quot;classic&quot; shows.  On occasion\nsomeone will reseed torrents on etree if you're lucky.  \n\nI'VE TRIED FOR A FEW WEEKS TO FIND 'HOPE' AND 'SEND' ONLINE WITHOUT\nLUCK, BUT THIS ONE IS WORTH DOWNLOADING DESPITE THEM MISSING.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb291f8f11949ba8c7f684b0219ff72cc871553e","amp;dn":"Widespread+Panic+-+1997-05-10+-+Roy+Wilkins+Civic+Auditorium+in+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb291f8f11949ba8c7f684b0219ff72cc871553e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,41,31,143,17,148,155,168,199,246,132,176,33,159,247,44,200,113,85,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
