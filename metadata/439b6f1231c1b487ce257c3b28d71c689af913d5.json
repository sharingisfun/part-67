Reviews and research papers describe air pollution in a variety of context, such as: evolution of air pollutant, urban structure effects, exposure in agriculture, surface ozone monitoring, the respiratory diseases impacts, appropriate technology, and response management to the air pollution.\n\nThe links between air pollutants and health impacts are many and complex. The environmental health community is being challenged to take stronger mitigation to respect population health and is taking opportunities to further their implication. Recognizing, observing, and analyzing exposures are a promising way forward, but also raise a myriad of new challenges and questions, including what such approaches are, when and how they can put into practice, and what their implications are for protecting human health.\n\nContents\nSection 1 Current Characteristic of Air Pollutants\n1 Old and New Air Pollutants: An Evaluation on Thirty Years Experiences\n2 Urban Structure and Air Quality\n3 Particulate Matter Exposure in Agriculture\n4 Pollutants and Greenhouse Gases Emissions Produced by Tourism Life Cycle: Possible Solutions to Reduce Emissions and to Introduce Adaptation Measures\nSection 2 Air Pollution Monitoring and Health Effects\n5 Time Series Analysis of Surface Ozone Monitoring Records in Kemaman, Malaysia\n6 Particulate Air Pollutants and Respiratory Diseases\n7 Air Pollution and Death Due to Cardiovascular Diseases (Case Study: Isfahan Province of Iran)\n8 Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Surface Ozone in Urban Area: A Multilevel and Structural Equation Model Approach\nSection 3 Air Pollution Management and Prediction\n9 Non-Thermal Plasma Technic for Air Pollution Control\n10 Environmental Control and Emission Reduction for Coking Plants\n11 Mitigating Urban Heat Island Effects in Tehran Metropolitan Area\n12 Managing Emergency Response of Air Pollution by the Expert System\n13 Contribution of the Compressed Air Energy Storage in the Reduction of GHG - Case Study: Application on the Remote Area Power Supply System\n14 Advances in Spatio-Temporal Modeling and Prediction for Environmental Risk Assessment\n\n\n                                   By bobiras2009\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:439b6f1231c1b487ce257c3b28d71c689af913d5","amp;dn":"Air+Pollution+A+Comprehensive+Perspective+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"439b6f1231c1b487ce257c3b28d71c689af913d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,155,111,18,49,193,180,135,206,37,124,59,40,215,28,104,154,249,19,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
