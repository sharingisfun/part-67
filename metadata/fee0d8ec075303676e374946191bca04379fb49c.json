The barrister met the politician once, in 1906, and each manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subsequent relation to the issue of independence, up to its realization in 1947, guides HermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narrative. The tenor of the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presentation is that both Gandhi and ChurchillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s visions of IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future were illusory, and bear some blame for the convulsions of 1947 (partition, communal violence, and a Pakistani-Indian war). \n\nRooted in his youthful experiences in India, ChurchillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stout imperialism became an ever more impractical stance as GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advocacy of independence gained momentum over the decades. Descriptive about the latterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revered methods of nonviolence, Herman discerns an implied forcefulness behind them should, for example, a Gandhi fast touch off riots. If uncomplimentary toward GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political acumen, Herman presents his criticisms subtly, without impeding the brisk narrative flow. Showing history eluding Gandhi and Churchill, Herman provocatively presents their efforts to shape it.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fee0d8ec075303676e374946191bca04379fb49c","amp;dn":"Gandhi+%26amp%3B+Churchill+The+Epic+Rivalry+that+Destroyed+an+Empire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fee0d8ec075303676e374946191bca04379fb49c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,224,216,236,7,83,3,103,110,55,73,70,25,27,202,4,55,159,180,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
