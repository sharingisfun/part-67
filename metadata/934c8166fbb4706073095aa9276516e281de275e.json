Stop waiting for your computer to startup and use that time to do more interesting things!\n\n\nFaster startups, faster shutdowns\nZoom doesn't only accelerate shutdowns. By putting all startup items, including DOS ones, into cache, it can also accelerate startups up to 200%!\n\n\nFaster standby and resume, too\nIf you have a laptop, you certainly use standby and hibernation more than shutdown. They can also be accelerated by Zoom. What's more, Zoom will also accelerate resuming from standby and hibernation; wake your computer up from standby in a few seconds only!\n\n\nMore control over shutdown\nZoom gives you control over what your computer does. For example, you can instruct it to display a dialog box on shutdown, if you shut down your computer by mistake. Or perhaps you would like Zoom to automatically reboot a server when it needs to? With the &quot;Detected required reboots&quot; function, all you have to do is to tick a checkbox and Zoom will do the rest for you.\n\n\nEasy to use\nZoom's goal is to win time, not to lose some. Zoom's interface fully respects Microsoft's guidelines and is very intuitive. Zoom has a zero learning curve; if you know how to startup your computer, you'll know how to use Zoom.\n\n\nAnd much more \nZoom features other great functions, such as an improved shutdown dialog box, more convenient than Windows' one! It is impossible to list all of Zoom's functions on a single webpage, so why don't you download it now and quit waiting for your computer to become operational?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dachshundsoftware.com/zoom/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dachshundsoftware.com/zoom/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease seed and share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:934c8166fbb4706073095aa9276516e281de275e","amp;dn":"Zoom+1.3.1+Full..rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"934c8166fbb4706073095aa9276516e281de275e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,76,129,102,251,180,112,96,115,9,90,169,39,101,22,226,129,222,39,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
