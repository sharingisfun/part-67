This unthinkable invitation to the greatest story.&quot;\n\nLouie Giglio really understands how to break down Christianity to the core. This was the first of 6 or 7 of his podcasts that I listened to on my way down. The Passion Messages podcast can be seen and subscribed to (for any number of music applications) here.\n\nIf you really enjoy it (like I do) and want to use it for a lesson, etc, check out the DVD at the 268Store\n\nThis world is messed up in magnitude. But there is a more amazing God who has invited us to know him, linking arms with us that we might be amplifiers for the beauty of Jesus to all peoples.\n\nHe is not only a global God Ã¢â‚¬â€ he's a galatic God. He is bigger than anything we can imagine. We don't have a clue, really, about who we are dealing with. The universe was one of God's thoughts.\n\nConsider the scene of Isaiah 6: Isaiah saw the LORD. God was high and lifted up, not low and watered down. Isaiah realized at some point in that scene that worship will happen with or without him. And it wrecked him. Isaiah felt the weight. He was finished. Are we carrying this? Do we feel this, too?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54b60f9013e2da09232a3dfcfddc1ba7c216ea98","amp;dn":"POtHS+2+-+Bible+Study+-+Part+70+-+Louie+Giglio+-+Unthinkable+Tou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54b60f9013e2da09232a3dfcfddc1ba7c216ea98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,182,15,144,19,226,218,9,35,42,61,252,253,220,27,167,194,22,234,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
