By this time of night I'm a little too drunk to do any serious analyzation of any music but I will tell you this:  Download the Demon Days! Ones of my favorite albums of all time and the reason I respect Danger Mouse so much as a producer. This is a must hear. And in lossless FLAC!? My god! Sweet Jesus! Get it now!\n\nHere's the list:\n\nCD: Gorillaz - Demon Days\n       YEAR: 2005\n\n01. Intro    [0:01:03.12]\n02. Last Living Souls    [0:03:10.30]\n03. Kids With Guns    [0:03:45.63]\n04. O Green World    [0:04:31.72]\n05. Dirty Harry    [0:03:43.60]\n06. Feel Good Inc.    [0:03:41.13]\n07. El MaÃƒÂ±ana    [0:03:50.02]\n08. Every Planet We Reach Is Dead    [0:04:53.20]\n09. November Has Come    [0:02:41.08]\n10. All Alone    [0:03:30.05]\n11. White Light    [0:02:08.32]\n12. Dare    [0:04:04.23]\n13. Fire Coming Out Of The Monkey's Head    [0:03:16.32]\n14. Don't Get Lost In Heaven    [0:02:00.28]\n15. Demon Days    [0:04:28.67]\n\nShit this is from 2005!? That's older than I thought!  Anyway, I still play this album regularly and it's great. Totally different than the first gorillaz album (not that I didn't like that one too) - all the tracks flow smoothly into the next and its completely beautiful. I forgot to make a log file for this one but its ripped with EAC 0.99 and checked with AccurateRip.  Tracks 2, 6, and 7 had &quot;suspicious positions&quot; but I have played through them personally and didn't notice anything different from what I normally hear with the CD in the CD player.\n\nCongratulations on your download! Support the artists!\n\n-slavetothesound","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:393f68a78ed3a830d995e7574bd4143be6c64e90","amp;dn":"Gorillaz+-+Demon+Days+-+slavetothesound%27s+FLAC+series+no+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"393f68a78ed3a830d995e7574bd4143be6c64e90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,63,104,167,142,211,168,48,217,149,231,87,75,212,20,59,230,198,78,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
