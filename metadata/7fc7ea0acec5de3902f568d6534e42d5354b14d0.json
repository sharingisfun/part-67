They do not truly hide your identity.\n \nVPN's are a little piece of software running from your PC where your real\nIP address is. There is a digital trail leading right back to your desktop.\nThere is no 100% guarantee of anonymity with any service.\n \nThis does not mean I will no longer be uploading anything ever again;\njust not anything ever again to TPB. There are a few other sites I\nregularly upload all the same goodies to, so you can find the latest\ntNe releases over there.\n \nBesides, haven't you noticed how drab and functionless TPB is?\n \nOver and out.\n \n-tNe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fc7ea0acec5de3902f568d6534e42d5354b14d0","amp;dn":"Farewell+TPB.txt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fc7ea0acec5de3902f568d6534e42d5354b14d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,199,234,10,206,197,222,57,2,245,104,214,83,78,66,213,53,75,20,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
