It is the story of Ã¢â‚¬ËœJack the HackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a less than average, but once successful screenwriter who now faces writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s block. Desperate to meet a career-saving deadline and lock out the distractions of his troubled life, Jack arranges to be left alone and locked inside a meat cooler, with only vegetarian meals and his imagination to inspire him. As the temperature drops, the lines between reality and fiction blur, and JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s script comes dangerously to life. Will he make the most important deadline of his career? Or is Jack Ã¢â‚¬Ëœjust a hackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢? While writing the script, the actual screenwriter and producer of BELOW ZERO, Signe Olynyk, arranged to have herself physically locked in the meat freezer of an abandoned, remote slaughterhouse. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s partly how this story developed. It was filmed at the same location.\n\nSize: 419304547 bytes (399.88 MiB), duration: 01:38:09, avg.bitrate: 570 kb/s\nAudio: aac, 48000 Hz, stereo (eng)\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 720x304, 29.97 \nsource : doridro\n\nScreenshot\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/2499/covervvy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/2499/covervvy.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/3013/vlcsnap2012090113h11m58.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/3013/vlcsnap2012090113h11m58.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/2561/vlcsnap2012090113h14m59.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/2561/vlcsnap2012090113h14m59.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/3074/vlcsnap2012090113h12m09.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/3074/vlcsnap2012090113h12m09.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy\n\nAlways Entertainment\n\n\nkeep seed after download\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfd2a47741392108f0bdf02cd0a5125309374b0d","amp;dn":"Below+Zero+2011++Dvdrip+Pankhabd.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfd2a47741392108f0bdf02cd0a5125309374b0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,210,164,119,65,57,33,8,240,189,240,44,208,165,18,83,9,55,75,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
