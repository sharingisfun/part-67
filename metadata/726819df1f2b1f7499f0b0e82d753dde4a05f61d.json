Kolln (Author), Robert W. Funk (Author)\nPublication Date: September 29, 2011 | ISBN-10: 0205209521 | ISBN-13: 978-0205209521 | Edition: 9\nThis market-leading text for grammar courses is a comprehensive description of sentence structure that encourages students to recognize and use their innate language expertise as they study the systematic nature of sentence grammar.\nA practical blend of the most useful elements of both traditional and new linguistic grammar, the text emphasizes whole structures, most specifically the ten basic sentence patterns introduced in Chapter 3. Two key features separate this book from others: its clear organization and its user-friendly, accessible language. Both students and teachers appreciate the self-teaching quality that incremental exercises provide throughout the chapters, with answers at the end of the book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:726819df1f2b1f7499f0b0e82d753dde4a05f61d","amp;dn":"Understanding+English+Grammar+9th+edition+by+Martha+Kolln+and+Ro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"726819df1f2b1f7499f0b0e82d753dde4a05f61d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,104,25,223,31,43,31,116,153,240,176,232,45,117,61,222,74,5,246,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
