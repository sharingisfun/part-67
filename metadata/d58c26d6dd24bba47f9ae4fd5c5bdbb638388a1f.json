ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s based on the ideas I focussed upon when mentoring new physics teachers.&quot;\n\n...\n\nI've spent a good deal of time considering my options while searching for an Agent ad Publisher, and in that time I became convinced that since my goal has always been to affect the way physics was taught, and subsequently to market and network myself within that community of my colleagues, that it was best to release the book at no charge. \n\nMoney is not my concern, but it may be for beginning teachers so burdening them with another cost early on in their careers seemed unwarranted. There is so much material available over the internet in the form of media files, animations, blogs, Lecture notes, Lab guides, Questions and Answers etc... IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to do my part by adding to that free flow of information. \n\n...\n\nThe Open Agenda is free to download and distribute according to a Creative Commons license.\n\nPlease share and distribute the book accordingly.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Daicopoulos&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d58c26d6dd24bba47f9ae4fd5c5bdbb638388a1f","amp;dn":"The+Open+Agenda%3A+Ideas+a+beginning+physics+teacher+should+not+ta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d58c26d6dd24bba47f9ae4fd5c5bdbb638388a1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,140,38,214,221,36,187,164,127,154,228,253,92,91,219,182,56,56,138,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
