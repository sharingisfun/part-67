The two met while Gandhi was banished to South Africa, and were separated in 1914, when he returned to India and Kallenbach was not allowed in due to World War I.\nGandhi wrote to Kallenbach: &quot;How completely thou have taken possession of my body. This is slavery with a vengeance.&quot; In a letter to Kallenbach, he promised not to &quot;look lustfully upon any woman,&quot; and pledged &quot;such love as...the world has not yet seen.&quot;\n\nLelyveld also claims that Gandhi had racist views of the blacks in South Africa, complaining that they are &quot;as a rule uncivilized.&quot;\n\n&quot;We were marched off to a prison intended for [blacks],&quot; he wrote. &quot;We could understand not being classed with whites, but to be placed on the same level as the Natives seemed too much to put up with.&quot;\n \n \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jpost.com/ArtsAndCulture/Books/Article.aspx?ID=214133&amp;R=R1&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jpost.com/ArtsAndCulture/Books/Article.aspx?ID=214133&amp;R=R1&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45b7ad6292c0824790a2f8279542598e34570562","amp;dn":"Gandhi%26rsquo%3Bs+role+in+India%26rsquo%3Bs+freedom-British+Hero++or+pa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45b7ad6292c0824790a2f8279542598e34570562","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,183,173,98,146,192,130,71,144,162,248,39,149,66,89,142,52,87,5,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
