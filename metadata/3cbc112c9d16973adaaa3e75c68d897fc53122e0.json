He has bad eyesight, a pure heart, and a secret crush on the store manager, Rokka. Unfortunately for him, Rokka swore off love 8 years ago. But when Ryosuke goes up to her apartment on the second floor, he runs into a good-looking half-naked man. At first upset, he learns that this isn't Rokka's live-in boyfriend; he's the ghost of her late husband, Atsushi. She can't see him, and Ryosuke decides not to give up on her, even with a dead husband standing in the way.\n\n\n\nGenres: Drama, Romance, Supernatural, Josei\n\n\nDuration: 24 min. per episode\n\n\nRating: PG-13 - Teens 13 or older\n\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\n\nRelease date : August 17, 2012\n\n\nSubTitle language : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cbc112c9d16973adaaa3e75c68d897fc53122e0","amp;dn":"%5BWhyNot%5D+Natsuyuki+Rendezvous+-+07+%5B094E9E38%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cbc112c9d16973adaaa3e75c68d897fc53122e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,188,17,44,157,22,151,58,218,170,62,117,198,141,137,127,197,49,34,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
