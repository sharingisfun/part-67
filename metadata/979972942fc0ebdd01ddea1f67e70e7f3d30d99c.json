The only alternative he sees is to willfully slip into a coma. But one year later, Miguel becomes a walking urban legend after he wakes up virtually unchanged -- except for his sloth-like pace. Soon, a haunted lemon orchard, the mysterious goat man, and murder will collide as Miguel, his girlfriend Lita and their best friend Romeo take on the teenage wasteland that is suburbia in the 21st century.\n\nWill Miguel find love? Or has he risen from his slumber just to end up another rock and roll suicide? In this hypnotic, coming-of-age tale, Gilbert Hernandez deftly defines what it means to truly be alive in a land where life is not precious.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:979972942fc0ebdd01ddea1f67e70e7f3d30d99c","amp;dn":"Gilbert+Hernandez+-+Sloth+%28GN%29+%28Vertigo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"979972942fc0ebdd01ddea1f67e70e7f3d30d99c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,153,114,148,47,192,235,221,1,221,234,31,103,231,14,127,61,48,217,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
