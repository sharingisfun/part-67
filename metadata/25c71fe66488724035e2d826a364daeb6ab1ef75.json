As an honors student who was also good at sports, the charming girl was popular with her classmates. When she suddenly died, her classmates decided to carry on as if she was still alive until graduation. Then, in the spring of 1998, a boy named Sakakibara Kouichi transfers to that classroom, and he grows suspicious of the fearful atmosphere in that classroom. In particular, there is a beautiful, aloof girl named Mei Misaki who wears an eye-patch and is always alone drawing pictures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25c71fe66488724035e2d826a364daeb6ab1ef75","amp;dn":"Another+%28Complete+English+Sub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25c71fe66488724035e2d826a364daeb6ab1ef75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,199,31,230,100,136,114,64,53,226,216,38,163,100,218,235,106,177,239,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
