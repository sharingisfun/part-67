From death stars to ringed planets, star clusters to space wars, THE UNIVERSE uses new discoveries and more advanced CGI to help explain the mysteries of outer space. From wormholes to transporters, examine which elements from popular sci-fi movies could really exist; and discover how the universe is awash in all sorts of strange liquids, from oceans of methane to blobs of alcohol floating in space, and even iron rain. Watch and marvel as experts cook up ten ways to destroy the Earth, including blowing it up with anti-matter, hurling it into the Sun, and colliding with another galaxy.\n&quot;I have uploaded Series 4; it's the only Series of The Universe that is missing on MVGroup and I have had over the past year quite a lot of requests for it&quot; cheers Harry\n\n\n\n\n\n3)  It Fell from Space \nEvery year, thousands of objects both natural and manmade plummet through our atmosphere and crash into the Earth. These menacing messengers from the sky provide scientists with amazing insights into the natural, and not so natural, phenomena of the cosmos. From space rocks crashing through homes to cosmic boulders triggering mass extinctions to rocket parts landing on front lawns, explore objects that fall from the heavens, such as asteroids, comets, meteor showers and space debris.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img857.imageshack.us/img857/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img857.imageshack.us/img857/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img36.imageshack.us/img36/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img36.imageshack.us/img36/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img171.imageshack.us/img171/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img171.imageshack.us/img171/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/9585/theuniverseseason4scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1874 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 45.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 12\n * Part Size: 640 MB\n * Source : DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.history.com/shows/the-universe/interactives/facts-about-the-universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.history.com/shows/the-universe/interactives/facts-about-the-universe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:677ef0579b7c5b8153b7f27878b8bbe54322ae43","amp;dn":"History+Ch+The+Universe+Season+4+03of12+It+Fell+From+Space+XviD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"677ef0579b7c5b8153b7f27878b8bbe54322ae43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,126,240,87,155,124,91,129,83,183,242,120,120,184,187,229,67,34,174,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
