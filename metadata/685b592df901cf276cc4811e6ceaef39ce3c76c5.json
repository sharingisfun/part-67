What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 11 - Thursday - Tonight's challenge is an emotional one as one family member for each contestant is brought in. The four contestants will have to cook the meal their loved ones have missed the most. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:685b592df901cf276cc4811e6ceaef39ce3c76c5","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E65.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"685b592df901cf276cc4811e6ceaef39ce3c76c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,91,89,45,249,1,207,39,108,196,129,30,108,234,239,57,206,60,118,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
