Released under the new stage name Makaveli, it was his first studio album to be posthumously released. The album was completely finished in a total of seven days during the month of August 1996. The lyrics were written and recorded in only three days and mixing took an additional four days. These are among the very last songs Shakur recorded before his fatal shooting on September 7, 1996.\nIn 2005, MTV.com ranked Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory at #9 on their greatest hip hop albums of all time list and, in 2006, recognized it as a classic. The emotion and anger showcased on the album has been admired by a large part of the hip-hop community, including other rappers.[10] Ronald &quot;Riskie&quot; Brent is the creator of the Makaveli Don Killuminati cover painting.[11] George &quot;Papa G&quot; Pryce, Former Head of Publicity for Death Row, claimed that &quot;Makaveli which we did was a sort of tongue-in-cheek, and it was not really to come out, [but] after Tupac was murdered, it did comout... Before that, it was going to be a sort of an underground. The album peaked at number one on the Billboard Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the Billboard 200.[13] The album generated the second-highest debut-week sales total of any album that year,selling 664,000 copies on the first week. This album was certified 4X Platinum on June 15, 1999. The Don Killuminati is widely considered classic by numerous hip hop fans and critics.\n\nThough Shakur had been using the name Makaveli as far back as All Eyez On Me, the Makaveli album was conceived as a sort of introduction for Shakur's alternate stage name. Thus, the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sleeve contains the text, &quot;Exit 2Pac, Enter Makaveli&quot;, referring to the exit of the Shakur of the past and the new person, Makaveli.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f93f4535cc63a3f16af20ff53954d1ecc5886a91","amp;dn":"Makaveli%2F+The+Don+Killuminati+The+7+Day+Theory+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f93f4535cc63a3f16af20ff53954d1ecc5886a91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,63,69,53,204,99,163,241,106,242,15,245,57,84,209,236,197,136,106,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
