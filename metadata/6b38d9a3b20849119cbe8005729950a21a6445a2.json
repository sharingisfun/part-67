The three members were barely out of their teens when they became a musical sensation during 1972, scoring No. 1 hits and winning a Grammy for best new musical artist. Their recording success stretched throughout the 1970s; some of the band's best known songs are &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot;, &quot;Sister Golden Hair&quot; (both of which reached No. 1), &quot;Ventura Highway&quot;, &quot;Tin Man&quot;, &quot;Daisy Jane&quot;, and &quot;Lonely People&quot;. George Martin produced seven of their albums.\n\nThe band suffered a heavy blow when Dan Peek quit the group in 1977, right at the bottom of a steep decline in their popularity, but Beckley and Bunnell returned to the top 10 as a duo with &quot;You Can Do Magic&quot; in 1982. Continuing to tour, America maintains a loyal fan base and performs over 100 shows per year.[1]\n\nOn January 16, 2007, America released Here &amp; Now, the band's first major label studio album in over twenty years.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b38d9a3b20849119cbe8005729950a21a6445a2","amp;dn":"America+-+History-Greatest+Hits+%5B1975%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b38d9a3b20849119cbe8005729950a21a6445a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,56,217,163,178,8,73,17,156,190,128,5,114,153,80,162,26,100,69,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
