For this he's forced leave his clan and his fiance under unfortunate stars. Beyond its fairly simple yet effective premise The Betrayal can be described as a companion piece to Masaki Kobayashi's masterful Seppuku (Harakiri, 1962). Both films highlight the hypocrisy and hollowness of the samurai code. While Seppuku (which I happen to consider the best Japanese film to date) is a surprisingly modern drama in its style and how it handles its subject matter, The Betrayal is a gripping revenge story - much more common to the whole chambara genre. However The Betrayal runs almost like an ancient Greek tragedy but in a Tokugawa era setting where the mythical samurai code hides the social injustice that's governed by the caste system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7714c882dffbe8b0b3c6ef08bd534f49fd3dbb96","amp;dn":"Daisatsujin+orochi+aka+The+Betrayal+%28Tokuz%26ocirc%3B+Tanaka%2C+1966%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7714c882dffbe8b0b3c6ef08bd534f49fd3dbb96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,20,200,130,223,251,232,176,179,198,239,8,189,83,79,73,253,61,187,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
