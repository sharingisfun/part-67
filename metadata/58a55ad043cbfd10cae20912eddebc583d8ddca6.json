I'm stuck at a red light outside a 7-ELEVEN in Southampton, NY. An army of undocumented men stand on the corner in search of work. Across from them is a small, middle-aged man waving an American flag and a home-made sign that reads, &quot;Deport Illegals&quot;. Tom Weddel, is an out-of-work roofer who has stood by himself in the same spot every morning for the past five-years protesting against illegal immigration. I pull over and rip out my camera. A half-hour later I'm 30-minutes into a new film called, They Come to America. The film focuses on the human and financial costs of illegal immigration. We filmed over the span of 14-months and journeyed through Arizona, California, Illinois, Florida, DC, New York and Colorado. The debates, events, people, and places we captured on film is simply amazing. When it comes to the topic of illegal immigration, this is a first-of-its-kind film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58a55ad043cbfd10cae20912eddebc583d8ddca6","amp;dn":"They+Come+to+America+%282012%29+-+Dennis+Lynch+DVDRIP+ZULU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58a55ad043cbfd10cae20912eddebc583d8ddca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,165,90,208,67,203,253,16,202,226,9,18,237,222,188,88,61,141,220,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
