MakeMKV can be downloaded from here http://makemkv.com/ and Handbrake can be downloaded from here http://handbrake.fr/. Anybody who doesn't know these programs are, MakeMKV can rip/backup BluRay discs into a MKV file which you can encode/decode into an even smaller MKV or Mp4 file for viewing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43cf3deda1f9fa2414af967ee4e94fb86b9be8c6","amp;dn":"DTSHDDec.dll","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43cf3deda1f9fa2414af967ee4e94fb86b9be8c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,207,61,237,161,249,250,36,20,175,150,126,228,233,79,184,107,155,232,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
