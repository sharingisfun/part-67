In a photo of such a scene the bright areas look washed out and everything in shadows is pictured as a black spot with no details. The HDR technique allows you to capture details in bright and dark areas and have them merged in a single photo.\n\nFeatures:\n\n    Full resolution\n    Real HDR: exposure bracketing and tone mapping\n    Simple: take a HDR image in one tap\n    HDR images fused and tone mapped on device within seconds\n    Hand shake compensation, no need to be rock-solid while shooting\n    Correct handling of moving objects, de-ghosting\n    You can control tone-mapping parameters: contrast, micro-contrast, color vividness, exposure\n    Save original exposure bracketed images\n    Location tagging\n    Shutter sound can be muted (not on all models)\n    Support for Flash on/off/auto\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Aug 21, 2012)\n\n    rare overflow fixed\n    Jelly Bean: fixed images appear duplicated in gallery\n    fix for users upgrading on Jelly Bean\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.2+\n\n\n                                  By bobiras2009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87d7176dd03539d401e2e0736575051ea73023a9","amp;dn":"HDR+Camera%2B+v2.25+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87d7176dd03539d401e2e0736575051ea73023a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,215,23,109,208,53,57,212,1,226,224,115,101,117,5,30,167,48,35,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
