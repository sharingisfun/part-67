The film is a modern day story of the Greek mythological tale and inspired by the 1964 classic Hammer film The Gorgon and the 1981 cult classic Clash of the Titans. It is Jean Rollin's final film, as the director died in late 2010. It was thought that Rollin's 2007 film La nuit des horloges was the final film of his career as he had mentioned in the past, as he did many years before after he directed Killing Car. But in 2009, Rollin began preparation for his next project, in which he entitled Le masque de la MÃƒÂ©duse, a modern day re-telling of the Gorgon, a mythological female creature with snakes for hair. Rollin originally directed the film as a one hour short, which was screened at the CinÃƒÂ©mathÃƒÂ¨que de Toulouse, but after the release, Rollin decided to add twenty minutes of additional scenes and then cut the film into two distinct part, as he did in his first feature Le Viol du Vampire. The film was shot on location at the Golden Gate Aquarium, the PÃƒÂ¨re Lachaise Cemetery and on stage the Theatre du Grande Guignol, which is where the longest part of the film takes place. It was shot on HD video on a low-budget of Ã¢â€šÂ¬150,000, before the release it was blown-up to 35mm film.\n\nFile Name ............................: Medusa's.Mask.2010.Jean.Rollin.avi\nFile Size ............................: 1,056,185,954 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:13:15\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x400 (AR: 1.760)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1785 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.254 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC..........................: B-VOP\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0d1cf758ab7ed6a9339616baf3ac094e644ddfa","amp;dn":"Jean+Rollin+-+Le+Masque+de+la+M%26eacute%3Bduse+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0d1cf758ab7ed6a9339616baf3ac094e644ddfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,209,207,117,138,183,237,106,147,57,97,107,175,58,192,148,230,68,221,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
