With shortcuts, power ups, performance upgrades, Turbo boosts and Jumps, 4 Wheel Thunder packs as much gameplay as possible into each race. It's the latest worthy title in Midway's Thunder series designed to over-stimulate your driving senses. \n\nThis game is perfectly emulated, just run the installer (keep the install path as default), Setup xpadder (Optional), run the game with the shortcut on the desktop. To quit the game in Fullscreen mode, press Ctrl &amp; Esc together.\n\nNote: Music has been removed but the game sounds are there.\nIf you have any issues, go to the game folder &amp; read the README file.\n\nThis game is fun to play, but hard to master, you WILL need skill &amp; patience.\n\nMy Screens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gAabgAAeG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gAabgAAeG&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gAaBdaaEG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gAaBdaaEG&lt;/a&gt;\n\n                            Please seed and enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33197360fa9efcbd28e8f57076566cbbed0d559d","amp;dn":"4+Wheel+Thunder+%28Emulated%29+%2B+Xpadder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33197360fa9efcbd28e8f57076566cbbed0d559d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,25,115,96,250,158,252,189,40,232,245,112,118,86,108,187,237,13,85,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
