Indio is a ruthless, intelligent man. He has a musical pocketwatch that he plays before engaging in gun duels. &quot;When the chimes finish, begin&quot;, he says. Flashbacks reveal that the watch originates from a young woman (Rosemary Dexter), who killed herself while being raped by Indio after he had found her with her lover (in Joe Millard's novelization of the film, the young man is her newly-wed husband) and killed him. The watch bears a photo of the woman and was presented as a gift by the young man before being killed.\n\nScreenshots: http://postimage.org/gallery/890sqqb4/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:585c19034fe31f8def2dd1931dbc3eff8bf711d2","amp;dn":"For+A+Few+%24+More+%5B1965%5D%5BXviD%5D+Hobiten","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"585c19034fe31f8def2dd1931dbc3eff8bf711d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,92,25,3,79,227,31,141,239,45,209,147,29,188,62,255,139,247,17,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
