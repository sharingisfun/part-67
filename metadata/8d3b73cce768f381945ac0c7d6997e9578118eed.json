The Martian marine base acts as security for AGM corporation (AGM), a multi-planetary conglomerate, which is performing secret experiments with teleportation by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos.\n\nPhobos is considered by space marines to be the dullest assignment imaginable: &quot;with no action for eighty million miles, your day consisted of suckin' sand and watchin' flicks in the rec room.&quot; This all changes when the AGM experiments go horribly wrong.\n\nComputer systems on Phobos malfunction, Deimos disappears entirely, and &quot;something fragging evil&quot; starts pouring out of the gateway, killing or possessing all AGM personnel. Responding to a frantic distress call from the overrun scientists, the Martian marine unit is quickly sent to Phobos to investigate, where youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re left to guard the hangar with only a pistol while the rest of the group proceeds inside. Over the course of the next few hours, you hear assorted garbled radio messages, gunfire, and screams, followed by silence: &quot;Seems your buddies are deadÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or WORSEÃ¢â‚¬Â¦&quot;\n\nAs the last man standing, your mission is to fight through the entire onslaught of demonic enemies by yourself in order to keep them from attacking Earth.\n\n**** **** ****\n\nThe stock market got you down?
