From the beginning players can lightly customize the appearance of the protagonist such as shape of face and body, and skin colour. As is common in role-playing games, the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s character will level up by gaining experience points through completion of quests and defeating enemies. Much of the in-game world can be fully explored from the beginning, regardless of how much the player has progressed through the main story arc. Despite being non-linear, many areas of the land are populated by strong foes with higher levels than that of the player initially and as a result, players may want to explore them once their character has improved. While players will travel across much of the landscape on foot, they are soon given the option to ride on horseback and even later, a chance to man the helm of a boat to sail across the seas between islands. In addition players can also fast travel using magical teleportation fixtures found across the map.\n\n\nEXPANSION:\nPirates of the Flying Fortress features new animations, new recorded dialog, customization options, n new map area with a 10 hour campaign.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHELP ME SEED MY LOW-SEEDED TORRENTS SO I CAN UPLOAD MORE N NOT WORRY ABOUT THE OLD ONES\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI HAVE A FEW ONLINE PLAYABLE TORRENTS SO FAR:\nLand of the Dead\nPostal 1 and Postal 2 Share The Pain (All Mods)\nSniper Elite\nSerious Sam: The First and Second Encounter\nNexuiz\nall doom, heretic sotsr, hexen + ddc, n similar stuff (52 games)    NOTE: This Requires a mod to play online (skulltag), it's free, google it\nDoom Collection (all the older doom games)  NOTE: This Requires a mod to play online (skulltag), it's free, google it\nOTHERS CAN MOST LIKELY BE PLAYED VIA HAMACHI\n\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6c586bc7f9515e3c464290c9042659cebc98737","amp;dn":"two+worlds+2+%28v1.3%29+%2B+DLC+%28POTFF%29+%28Sandbox+RPG%29+%28Latest+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6c586bc7f9515e3c464290c9042659cebc98737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,197,134,188,127,149,21,227,196,100,41,12,144,66,101,156,235,201,135,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
