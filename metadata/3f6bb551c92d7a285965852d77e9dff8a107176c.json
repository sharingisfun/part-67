Players switch between control of four UPA agents, each with their own special abilities, as they work their way through a city that has grown upward and upward, leaving delving buildings and neighborhoods &quot;below city limits.&quot;. Among other unique mechanics of Project Eden is the fact that player characters don't die; instead, they are respawned at the last checkpoint, where their health is fully restored. With its emphasis on puzzle-solving over combat, the game may be thought of as a cyberpunk updating of The Lost Vikings, as it has more in common with that game developed by Blizzard Entertainment than traditional first- or third-person shooters. A single player can control any of the four characters at any given time, and other players can jump in at any time and assume control of team members.\n\n\nXpadder with profiles for Xbox360 &amp; PS3 included.\n\nNOTE: At the end of installation click on the &quot;View&quot; button to enter the &quot;REGKEY&quot; into the registry.
