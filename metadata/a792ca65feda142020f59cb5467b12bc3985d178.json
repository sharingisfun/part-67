Whether it's animals behaving oddly or even the planet that perplexes, each episode sees scientists studying baffling phenomena in a bid to understand what Mother Nature's really up to. The reasons behind incidents will vary, but there's one conclusion that we always reach: the world isn't as predictable as we'd like to think.\n\n\n\nEpisode 6 : Man Eating Lions\n\nTanzanians are under siege from a plague of man-eating lions - it has the world's largest lion population but until recently attacks were far and few between. All of that has changed. Over six hundred people have been killed in the last fifteen years in the South East of the country. How and why is lion behaviour changing to targeting human beings as a prey source?\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2087 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 50:19.720\nNumber Of Parts: 8\nPart Size: 825 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a792ca65feda142020f59cb5467b12bc3985d178","amp;dn":"Ch5.Nature.Shock.6of8.Man.Eating.Lions.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a792ca65feda142020f59cb5467b12bc3985d178","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,146,202,101,254,218,20,32,32,245,156,181,70,123,18,188,57,133,209,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
