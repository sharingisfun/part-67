Using the tools of Jungian psychology, the nature of the\nsingularity is defined by its myriad manifestations emerging from the\ncollective unconscious. These include dreams, motifs and themes found in\nart, science fiction and fantasy literature and films, religious cults,\nand the paranormal, especially near-death experiences and UFO\nencounters. Key aspects of the Singularity Archetype include: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Logos\nBeheldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (visually comprehended linguistic intent often associated with a\ncollective telepathic network), Homo gestalt (a new species where\nindividuality is conserved but also telepathically networked), and a\nparallelism between the individual event horizon of death and eschaton\n(the collective event horizon of the species). Apocalypticism is\nanalyzed as an example of the Singularity Archetype pathologizing. A\nstudy of the HeavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gate saucer/suicide cult illustrates what can\nhappen when people become possessed by the Singularity Archetype and are\ndriven by it into delusory projections. The Singularity Archetype is\nviewed apocalyptically by the ego, and as a transcendent evolutionary\nevent by the Self, and the duality of these views is explored in many\nexamples. The evolutionary origins of the ego and its metamorphosis as\nit approaches the event horizon are explored. Evolutionary theory, which\nrelates to the Singularity Archetype through a number of dynamic\nparadoxes, is discussed. Many popular books and movies are analyzed as\npermutations of the Singularity Archetype, including: Avatar, ChildhoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s End,\nVillage of the Damned, Powder, and 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\n________________________________\n\nTMRN Interviews Present:\nJonathan Zap\n\n\nFeaturing\nThe Mighty Time Monk Radio Arts Players\n\n\nHost:\nMacLaren\n\n\nRoundTable Members:\nChipperDogg, Disastercat, Greenmeadow, MamaBear and Uranus Rising\n\nMusic:\nKevin MacLeod\n\n\nTechnical Director:\nNeo\n\n\nAssociate Producers:\nGreenMeadow ~ Lennie ~ Gemini ~ Uranus Rising ~ Chipperdogg\n\n\nExecutive Producer:\nFoxx\n\n\n\n____________________________________\nMP3 Tags are Set\n\n\nMP3: 44000hz; Stereo; 64 Kbps.\nLength-----2:49:42 77.6 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3795ae76b9d44f4e47f17be0b0e6b97f00a49ec","amp;dn":"Time+Monk+Radio+-+Jonathan+Zap+-+Crossing+the+Event+Horizon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3795ae76b9d44f4e47f17be0b0e6b97f00a49ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,121,90,231,107,157,68,244,228,127,23,190,11,14,107,151,240,10,73,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
