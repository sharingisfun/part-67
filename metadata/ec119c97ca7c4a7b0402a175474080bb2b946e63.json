However, I can't be 100% sure since\nno torrent I saw on etree exactly matched perfectly (specifically not \nmentioning the 'Tuning' before set 2 and thetime length\nof each track).  Nonetheless, it sounds AWESOME.  \n100% sure.  Also, I listed them by SETLIST, not DISKS since we're going\naway from CD's these days.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec119c97ca7c4a7b0402a175474080bb2b946e63","amp;dn":"Widespread+Panic+-+1997-04-27+-+Memorial+Auditorium+in+Burlingto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec119c97ca7c4a7b0402a175474080bb2b946e63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,17,156,151,202,124,74,123,4,2,161,117,71,64,128,187,43,148,110,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
