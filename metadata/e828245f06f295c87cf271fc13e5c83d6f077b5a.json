It's told from the perspective of 15-year veteran network news cameraman Rustin Thompson, who covered the WTO as an independent journalist. It is the story of how Thompson's objective point-of-view evolved into a subjective account of what became an unscheduled, unruly outbreak of democracy.\n\nThompson, who had press credentials for the event, takes the viewer into the fray of tear gas, pepper spray, and police abuse; behind the lines and inside the convention center and press rooms; and along the marches, sit-ins, and demonstrations. His dynamic, up-close footage captures the passion, the confusion, the anger, and the courage of everyone involved, from protesters to police to delegates to bureaucrats.\n\nWith Thompson narrating, the film asks viewers to emotionally engage their own conflicting feelings about the demonstrations and behind-closed-doors meetings. &quot;I was intrigued by taking a singular, personal approach to the events,&quot; says Thompson, as he recounts how the protests affected him as a journalist and a common citizen. The result is an impressionistic journal of a decisive week that exploded into a massive expression of freedom: of speech, of assembly, and the press.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315734/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315734/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bullfrogfilms.com/catalog/30fr.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bullfrogfilms.com/catalog/30fr.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cinequest.org/event_view.php?eid=936&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cinequest.org/event_view.php?eid=936&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/waking-up-to-the-world/Content?oid=903106&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/waking-up-to-the-world/Content?oid=903106&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://libweb.lib.buffalo.edu/emro/emroDetail.asp?Number=690&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://libweb.lib.buffalo.edu/emro/emroDetail.asp?Number=690&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDVDrip with AutoGK\nRip Specs\n\nFormat : AVI\nFile size : 699 MiB\nDuration : 1h 8mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 420 Kbps\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n\nVideo #0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nCodec ID : XVID\nWidth : 544 pixels\nHeight : 336 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.619\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.237\n\nAudio #1\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 107 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e828245f06f295c87cf271fc13e5c83d6f077b5a","amp;dn":"30+Frames+A+Second+-+The+WTO+in+Seattle+-+2000+documentary+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e828245f06f295c87cf271fc13e5c83d6f077b5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,40,36,95,6,242,149,200,124,242,113,252,19,229,200,61,111,7,123,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
