That's where Miss Daisy sits.  She doesn't want a chauffeur and she wont give in.  Neither will Hoke.\n\nAlfred Uhry's moving Pulitzer Prize winning play became 1989's Academy Award winning Best Picture.  Driving Miss Daisy tells of genteel but strong willed Atlanta matron Daisy and her patient but equally determined chauffeur Hoke.  For two so different, they have a lot in common.  And the bumpy road they travel leads to the friendship of a lifetime.\n\n\nStars:\nJessica Tandy as Miss Daisy Werthan\nMorgan Freeman as Hoke Colburn\nDan Akroyd as Boolie Werthan\n\n\nXvid avi \n\nEnglish subs included in torrent\n\n\nPlease seed so others may enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a4df048cd8a8d86f437e57916e75e48cb17b845","amp;dn":"Driving+Miss+Daisy+%281989%29+%5Beng+subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a4df048cd8a8d86f437e57916e75e48cb17b845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,77,240,72,205,138,141,134,244,55,229,121,22,231,94,72,203,23,184,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
