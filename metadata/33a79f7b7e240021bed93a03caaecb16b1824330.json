Unlike the the other two projects, this is two full CDs of electronic instrumental music. USOE presents sonic visions that allow the listener to virtually share the experience. The second track, I am Dragonfly, epitomizes this idea as the title implies. The music is a vehicle that allows the listener to go beyond the artificial constraints of existential otherness.  \n\nVirtually is also about being almost something, without being specifically about anything at all. The artist is in search of a new music by being almost like other music we have heard before. After all in order to go somewhere new, we have to begin from where we are now, which, for USOE, is the sum of a myriad of musical styles and influences experienced over half a century. Motifs and idioms are often implied rather than fully expressed or developed. Styles are expressed in unconvential and unexpected ways. The facades of popular and commercial music are removed and only that which gurgles below the surface remains. The results are immediate, engaging and utterly unique.\n\nCorrected Version\nmp3 330kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33a79f7b7e240021bed93a03caaecb16b1824330","amp;dn":"United+States+of+Equanimity%3A+Virtually%2C+2012%2C+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33a79f7b7e240021bed93a03caaecb16b1824330","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,167,159,123,126,36,0,33,190,217,58,3,202,174,203,22,177,130,67,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
