Challenge your friends and family or try your skills against randomly chosen people.\n\nThere are no checks or predefined words; YOU are in control of the hangman game! Therefore, every language is supported. Our random games language picker helps you find people playing in the same language as you are.\n\nYou start out with 5 letters to use. For completing hangman games you earn coins, the higher you get, the more coins you can earn. With these coins you can buy additional letters, up to 50. With this you can create whole sentences! The first couple of letters are cheap, but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to work to get the last onesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nHang Me has been tested on multiple devices of all sizes. Most screen sizes are supported perfectly, including tablets and small phones. Yours isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t? See Feedback.\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also concentrated on keeping Hang Me small, the installed app takes about 2.6MB of space. It is moveable to SD Card, after which it only takes a little over 0.6 MB.\n\nPLUS features:\n-No ads or nagscreens.\n-Double the amount of games you can play.\n-Choose your own emoticon.\n\nAbout MeTa:\nHi, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Terry and Marco, two second-year IT students from the Netherlands. We love the big online multiplayer games like Rumble, Wordfeud and Draw Something.\nInstantly we agreed we should create a online multiplayer game ourselves. After two months of hard work we finally realized our dream. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re very proud of it and we hope you all enjoy Hang Me!\n\nFeedback:\nWe are still working on making Hang Me better, please try to be as descriptive as you can when you post comments. Any kind of feedback appreciated!\nPlease bear in mind we only have half a year of Android programming experience. We simply could not implement every feature we wanted. Same goes for our server, during peak hours you might get a second delay. The game plays fine on 3G but WiFi is preferred.\n\nFeel free to drop us an Email!\n\nHang me was entirely produced by MeTa. Hang Me, Hang Me + and Pet Care Tamagotchi are all owned and managed by MeTa. Any questions about Hang Me, Hang Me + and Pet Care Tamagotchi can be mailed to us.\n\nHangman is also known as galgje, hang the man, galgespil, galgenmann, le pendu, ahorcado, wisielec, jogo da forca, l'impiccato, ??? ????, gallowguy, gallow guy.\n\nTeam MeTa\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.meta.app.hangmeplus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.meta.app.hangmeplus&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f9196e408c39b6d96054a31ad1b5588d6896bcc","amp;dn":"Hang+Me+Plus+v1.01+APK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f9196e408c39b6d96054a31ad1b5588d6896bcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,145,150,228,8,195,155,109,150,5,74,49,173,27,85,136,214,137,107,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
