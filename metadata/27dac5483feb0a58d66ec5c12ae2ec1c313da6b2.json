Now has an alarm feature.\n\nFeatures:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fully configurable green, amber, red, and black icons\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Estimated charge / discharge time left\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Battery logging. You can log the battery state (charge, status, voltage, temperature) and browse the logs on the phone or export to CSV.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Manually or automatically disable / reenable device lock screen / lockscreen / keyguard\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Alarms (full, charge above X, charge below X, temperature above X, or health failure)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Themes for main window\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Lots of configurability; most features are optional\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Very lightweight (please email me if you think otherwise, and I'll help you figure out what's wrong Ã¢â‚¬â€ I promise this app will not drain your battery.)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Open source\n\nLimitations:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Motorola Droids and Samsung Moment only show every 10%\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ It's not possible to replace the built-in battery icon\n\n* Please see the project website (linked to below) to contact me if you have any questions or problems Ã¢â‚¬â€ I can't respond to comments left here. *\n\nWhat's in this version:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Shows separate notification when the lock screen is being disabled by the app. (This can be turned off if desired.)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Users of Jelly Bean (Android 4.1+) can set the notification priority. See full changelog for details. (Defaults to &quot;low&quot; priority to stay out of the way.)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Now only displays the voltage if the reported voltage is realistic. Some devices (e.g. Nexus 7) report an invalid voltage that is no longer displayed.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Made the main window action bar a brighter, more noticeable grey.\n\n                                    By bobiras2009\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27dac5483feb0a58d66ec5c12ae2ec1c313da6b2","amp;dn":"Battery+Indicator+Pro+v6.0.3+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27dac5483feb0a58d66ec5c12ae2ec1c313da6b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,218,197,72,63,235,10,88,214,110,197,193,42,226,236,28,49,61,166,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
