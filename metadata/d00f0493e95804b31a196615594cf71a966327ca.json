Guest host Michael Eric Dyson.                      \n\n96 days before the 2012 election and President Obama hammered Mitt Romney's plan to raise taxes on the middle class while Mitt horsed around with billionaire donors in Aspen.\n\nMichael showed Mitt's fancy dancing on taxes with Patrick Gaspard (Executive Director of the Democratic National Committee), and Karen Finney (MSNBC Political Analyst and former DNC Communications Director).\n\nJust how bad does RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan hit the middle class?  For that,Michael turned to Dean Baker (Co-Director of the Center for Economic Policy and Research). Meantime, compared the Obama and Romney tax plans and how they will specifically impact your family with the Obama campaign's online tax calculator.\n\nA 21-year-old black man was picked up by police while visiting Jonesboro, Arkansas.  Minutes later, he's dead. What happened to Chavis Carter?\n\nMichele Bachmann doubled down on her Islamophobic remarks. At what point does Mitt Romney need to speak out against this witch hunt? \n\nGuest host Michael Eric Dyson asked the Big Panel, including Jimmy Williams (former Democratic Senate Staffer and MSNBC Contributor),  Mark Simone (radio talk show host), and  Marcia Dyson (social activist).\n\nWhy on earth was Twitter getting on the great young gymnast Gabby Douglas over her hair?  Michael explained in an edition of Dyson-ary.\n\nAnd in the Big Finish, Mitt Romney meets with a victim of last month's movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado.  Michael asked the Rev. Jesse Jackson what it is going to take for someone to stand up and lead on increasing gun control.
