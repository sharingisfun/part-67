Some features are also available in OSX 10.7 (Lion).\n\nWhats New\nVersion 1.3.13:\nFIXED TotalFinder renders nicely on Retina MacBooks (issue)\nFIXED Visor auto-slides down when Finder loses active status. This should fix unreliable sliding historicaly based on losing keyboard focus (issue).\nFIXED No ghost windows after restarting (when Visor was pinned and up before restart).\nIMPROVED Prevents visual artifacts during Expose.\n\n\nPatch/Keygen courtesy of C.O.R.E.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3302739f6f8e8bafe0c600482d796577134dc461","amp;dn":"TotalFinder-1.3.13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3302739f6f8e8bafe0c600482d796577134dc461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,2,115,159,111,142,139,175,224,198,0,72,45,121,101,119,19,77,196,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
