Hadley (AgentParsec). It shares the same gameplay elements as the original - you must collect 8 pages while avoiding the enemy. This is not intended to be a copy - simply a way for people who loved Slender to be able to face their fear on a different map with the same awesome gameplay. There are some differences which will make playing a somewhat unique experience - different AI, new sounds, and a different environment.\n\nVersion 1.4 of Sanatorium has been released, which adds VSync, improves smoothness on all systems, and tweaks gameplay with improved page textures. Also fixes some bugs where you randomly die. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2c311ea23aad3b11c61c2446de558ae4b2effb2","amp;dn":"Slender+-+Sanatorium+v1.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2c311ea23aad3b11c61c2446de558ae4b2effb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,195,17,234,35,170,211,177,28,97,194,68,109,229,88,174,75,46,255,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
