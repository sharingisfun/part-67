J. Abbott, an octogenarian native of Ottawa. Mr. AbbottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs reflect influences from Ireland, England, and Scotland, with lyrics that relate swashbuckling pirate tales and mournful ballads of love lost. Liner notes include a personal account of Ms. FowkeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experience working with Mr. Abbott, a brief autobiography from the performer, and descriptions with lyrics for each track. Enjoy, and please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6e332a49a75b915976b3863616efbd584939a3d","amp;dn":"O.J.+Abbott+-+Irish+%26amp%3B+British+Songs+From+The+Ottawa+Valley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6e332a49a75b915976b3863616efbd584939a3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,227,50,164,154,117,185,21,151,107,56,99,97,110,251,213,132,147,154,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
