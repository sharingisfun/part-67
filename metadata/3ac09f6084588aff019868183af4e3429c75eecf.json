When her husband dies, his brother\n\nNasser is eager to take over the family by marrying Reyhan and raising her\n\nchildren in accordance with tradition.\n\nRight after her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funeral, the elder women in the family urge\n\nReyhan to shed her black mourning robes so that she can marry Nasser and\n\nwelcome him into her bed. But Reyhan respectfully rebuffs their urgings,\n\nsaying she is not ready.\n\n Though Nasser expresses a sincere sense of duty toward his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\n\nwidowed family, he becomes enraged when Reyhan repeatedly asserts her\n\nindependence by refusing to live with him, and then resurrects her late\n\nhusbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s run-down roadside cafe. When ReyhanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s culinary skills attract a\n\nloyal and growing following, including one very admiring Greek truck\n\ndriver, she threatens not only NasserÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own restaurant business, but his\n\nmanhood. Irate, he launches a relentless campaign to strip her of her\n\nlivelihood and her independence. Border CafÃƒÂ© is a complex portrait of the\n\nroles of women and men in modern Iran.\n\nReleased as Part of The Global Lens Collection,\n\nSDTV Rip- Divx- English Sub, 1hr 50 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ac09f6084588aff019868183af4e3429c75eecf","amp;dn":"LinkTV-Bridge+to+Iran-+Cafe+Transit+%28Border+Cafe%29+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ac09f6084588aff019868183af4e3429c75eecf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,192,159,96,132,88,138,255,1,152,104,24,58,244,227,66,156,117,238,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
