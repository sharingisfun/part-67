As with any half-baked scheme, everything can and does go wrong, testing the limits of Tommy and AudreyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship. The Babymakers is a hilarious twist on the heist film genre, a laugh-out loud comedy showing how far one couple will go in hopes of creating a new life. \n\nGenre: Adventure | Comedy \nIMDB Rating: 4.1/10 from 266 users \nDirected by: Jay Chandrasekhar \nStarring: Paul Schneider, Olivia Munn and Kevin Heffernan \n\nRelease Name: The Babymakers.2012.DVDRip.XviD.HS \nSize: 1.41 GB \nQuality: 640 x 264 | 23.976 | AC3 384 \nRuntime: 1h 35mn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e485da8b0b31c5ae1c6ac366188e6b1094b1da7","amp;dn":"The+Babymakers.2012.DVDRip.AC3.XviD.HS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e485da8b0b31c5ae1c6ac366188e6b1094b1da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,72,93,168,176,179,28,90,225,198,172,54,97,136,230,177,9,75,29,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
