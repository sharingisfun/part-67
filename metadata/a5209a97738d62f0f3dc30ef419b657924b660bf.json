There, he is struck by the beauty of a young woman, Josephine, and asks for hospitality at the house of Dr Hughes, her father. At dinner, he makes strange tricks inducing weird reactions in Josephine. The next day, he comes back when she is alone and makes her fall in a state of hypnotic lethargy before taking advantage of her. Overwhelmed by his powerful hypnotic gift, she follows him even though she seems to be disgusted and afraid of him. He takes her deep into the woods and continues to abuse her until he is arrested and tried. But how did Josephine accept to follow him?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5209a97738d62f0f3dc30ef419b657924b660bf","amp;dn":"Au+fond+des+bois+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5209a97738d62f0f3dc30ef419b657924b660bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,32,154,151,115,141,98,240,243,220,48,239,65,155,101,121,36,182,96,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
