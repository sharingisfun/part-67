Firebug gives you a good ol' fashioned command line for JavaScript complete with very modern amenities.\n\nLearn more\n.\n\nLogging for JavaScript\n\nHaving a fancy JavaScript debugger is great, but sometimes the fastest way to find bugs is just to dump as much information to the console as you can. Firebug gives you a set of powerful logging functions that help you get answers fast.\n\nLearn more\n.\n\nJust the way you like it\n\nUsing Firebug gives a lot of possibilities for web development to your hands.
