Mitt Romney is crying foul in a stunning display of hypocrisy.\nTonight, Jonathan Alter (MSNBC Political Analyst and Bloomberg View Columnist), and Michael Kinsley (Bloomberg View columnist), join Ed for that.\n\nNewt Gingrich admits Romney's welfare commercial is full of holes. Chris Kofinis (Democratic Strategist) agrees, and he'll join us to set Mitt straight.\n\nRepublicans aren't even trying to hide their voter suppression efforts in Ohio. We'll show you how they're rigging the vote ahead of the November election with Sen. Nina Turner (D-OH) and Ari Berman (Contributing Writer for The Nation and Rolling Stone).\n\nRomney thinks corporations are people.  But when it comes to releasing his tax returns, Mitt says he's &quot;not a business.&quot; The Big Panel John Hlinko (Democratic Strategist), Michelle Goldberg (Senior contributing writer, Newsweek &amp; The Daily Beast NY), Jonathan Alter (MSNBC Political Analyst and Bloomberg View Columnist) weighs in on the &quot;Romney reverse.&quot;\n\nAnd the Romney camp is out with another lie: that President Obama used his health care plan to declare war on religion.\n\nPlus, &quot;the Nuns on the Bus&quot; challenge Mitt to spend a day on tour. Sister Simone Campbell (Organizer of the Nuns on the Bus Tour, Executive Director of Network, a national Catholic social justice lobby), will tell us why Romney needs to be educated on AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poor.
