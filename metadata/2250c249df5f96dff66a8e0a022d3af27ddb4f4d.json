His own life is the stuff of great novels. Son of a Mexican father and Anglo mother, Urrea grew up first in Tijuana and then just across the border in San Diego. Over the years he has produced a series of acclaimed novels, including The HummingbirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Daughter, The DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Highway, and his latest, Queen of America Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each a rich and revealing account of the people of the borderlands that join and separate our two nations.\n\nEarlier this year, a number of books were removed from Tucson, Arizona classrooms when the Tucson school district eliminated a Mexican-American studies program on the accusation it was Ã¢â‚¬Å“divisive.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The program included references to UrreaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work. Urrea talks with Bill Moyers about that episode as he unfolds the modern reality of life on the border.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2250c249df5f96dff66a8e0a022d3af27ddb4f4d","amp;dn":"Between+Two+Worlds+%26mdash%3B+Life+on+the+Border-Moyers+%26amp%3B+Compa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2250c249df5f96dff66a8e0a022d3af27ddb4f4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,80,194,73,223,95,150,223,246,106,142,10,2,45,58,242,125,219,79,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
