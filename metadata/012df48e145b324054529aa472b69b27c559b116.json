It is revealed these creatures are actually the people and animals from your village transformed by a curse, and you alone have the power to free them. On your incredible adventure you carry the loud-mouthed head of one such fantastic creature with you - a somewhat uncooperative and ill-tempered but grudgingly helpful sidekick. Along with this new companion you must use your sword, crossbow, trusty musical horn, and wits to explore the lands, defeat the enemies, and solve puzzles in your quest to undo the curse that engulfs your homeland.\n\nHorn features:\n\n    Accessible controls that anyone can use- walking, jumping, crawling, even grapple hook, are all performed with intuitive gestures \n    Freely navigable console-quality detailed world- go wherever you want; not confined to limited path or rail \n    A rich and unique fantasy world \n    Touch-friendly melee combat and crossbow style weapons \n    3 unique and beautiful lands to discover \n    Endlessly escalating challenge modes \n    Hidden side content to discover \n    Score written by award winning Austin Wintory and performed with full live orchestra \n\nOptimized for Tegra2 and Tegra3 devices.\n\nRequired Android O/S : 3.2+\n\n\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:012df48e145b324054529aa472b69b27c559b116","amp;dn":"Horn+v0.9.3+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"012df48e145b324054529aa472b69b27c559b116","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,45,244,142,20,91,50,64,84,82,154,164,114,182,155,39,197,89,177,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
