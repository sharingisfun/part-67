It is the heartrending tale of a woman who is trapped between her natural instincts and the compulsions of her ancestral duty.\n\nChandi is a beautiful young woman from a scheduled caste, whose family has been traditionally in charge of a children's graveyard. When her father dies, there being no other male member in the family, Chandi inherits the job and performs it with great pride as a sacred duty. But when she becomes a mother herself, things begin to change. As a nursing mother, she starts getting upset about burying dead children and wants to be relieved of that duty. But neither the husband nor the people around understand her physical/emotional state...her moral dilemmas...her growing anxiety. When she rebels, the society, steeped in ignorance and superstitions, becomes increasingly hostile and ultimately condemns her in a harsh manner.\n\nIf Chandi gets justice in the end, it's only through the courage of her son.\n\nNandita Das won the Best Actress Award for this film at the Madrid International Film Festival, 2007 \n\nShe also won the V Shantaram Award for her performance in the film.\n\nCast:\nNandita Das\nKshitij Gavande\nAtul Kulkarni\n\nMedia Info :\nLanguage - Marathi (Indian)\nVideo Size - 640 MB\nVideo Codec - AVC\nVideo Res - 638 x 368\nVideo Frame Rate - 29.970 fps \nVideo Bitrate - 940 Kbps\nAudio Codec - MP3\nChannels - Stereo\nSample Rate - 44100 Hz @ 128 kbps\nLength - 1 Hour 35 mins\n\nPosters:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nSLMC.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nSLMC.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9PX7n.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9PX7n.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kCH9x.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kCH9x.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qH7AX.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qH7AX.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IhYxX.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IhYxX.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pdNDp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pdNDp.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dYW9Z.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dYW9Z.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/99Hiz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/99Hiz.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fOJuT.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fOJuT.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/guBOT.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/guBOT.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTakes me 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 2 Hours to Upload &amp; Months to Seed\n\nTakes me 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\n\nTakes you just 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;.
