River Media Center v17.0.182-MPT\n\nI found this and thought it would be nice to share it with TPB community. \nIt's not mine and I won't provide any support. I installed the application on my PC (Windows 7 64bit) two days ago and have no issues. \nThe file seems to be clean, Norton 2012 didn't detect any viruses or malware but I suggest you check it before installation.\n\nThe developers put a lot of time and resources to deliver a top quality software. If you like it then support them by buying a license. I did :D\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b7c62dac755025e6ca3d92b1f959e17e0367a6b","amp;dn":"J.+River+Media+Center+v17.0.182-MPT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b7c62dac755025e6ca3d92b1f959e17e0367a6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,124,98,218,199,85,2,94,108,163,217,43,31,149,158,23,224,54,122,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
