Chhaya is a simple housewife who has an artistic bent of mind and a seemingly happy life with her husband Arvind. Money trickles in every month and life goes on for an unassuming Chhaya, until her eyes catch hold of an unfinished sculpture of the Hindu Goddess Lakshmi.\n\nHer values and relationships as she knows them begin to decay day by day, surrendering to the clutches of an ugly obsession that feeds on her weaknesses and past disappointments. She must have the Ã¢â‚¬Å“LakshmiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, as if to make up for all that she has yearned for in her life.\n\nKshay takes an unforgiving look at obsession; how it infects the frailty of our minds, corroding reasoning, reality and emotional fulfilment.\n\nCredits to K@rtik for the rip-n-share\n\nimdb link - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1669648/\n\nCast:\nRasika Dugal...Chhaya\nAlekh Sangal...Arvind\nSudhir Pednekar...Bapu\nAdityavardhan Gupta...Sculptor\n\nMedia Info :\nLanguage - Hindi (Indian)\nVideo Size - 697 MB\nVideo Codec - H.264/AVC\nVideo Res - 720 x 272\nVideo Frame Rate - 25 fps @ 1049 Kbps\nAudio Codec - AC3 @ 5.1 Channel\nSample Rate - 48000 Hz @ 128 kbps\nLength - 1 hours 32 mins\n\nSample file included in the torrent.\n\nPosters:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GN4W6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GN4W6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens :\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DUVfn.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DUVfn.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Junjl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Junjl.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/z2tw9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/z2tw9.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XZa9m.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XZa9m.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTakes me 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 2 Hours to Upload &amp; Months to Seed\n\nTakes me 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\n\nTakes you just 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;.
