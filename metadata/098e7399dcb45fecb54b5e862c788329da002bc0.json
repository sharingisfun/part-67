It then organizes those snaps into a library where you can tag, rate and comment them.\n\nIt also comes with some built-in vector tools that allow you to mark up your images with text, callouts, shapes, lines, arrows, blurs and highlighting. Best of all, the annotations are all non-destructive allowing you to hide and show them at a moment's notice.\n\nThen share the snaps with your clients colleagues and friends. To make that possible, we've built in support for Flickr, image exports, FTP, SFTP and our own webservice especially for LittleSnapper users: QuickSnapper.\n\n\nWhat's New in Version 1.8.3 \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Stability improvements\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Other small fixes and enhancements.\n\n\nRequirements\nIntel, Mac OS X 10.6.6 or later ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:098e7399dcb45fecb54b5e862c788329da002bc0","amp;dn":"LittleSnapper+1.8.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"098e7399dcb45fecb54b5e862c788329da002bc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,142,115,153,220,180,95,236,181,75,94,134,44,120,131,41,218,0,43,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
