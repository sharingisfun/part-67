Notably (at least some\nversions of) VLC doesn't detect the audio track well at all.\nMedia Player Classic has no problem whatsoever.\nThe practical says - convert the audio to MP3, since AVI\ndoesn't do AAC well. But then I'd have to create a moniker\nand take credit for actually doing something here.\nBut MP3 is somewhat standard for AVI, so why not?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a5f25b66cc686014c71adb3e267e4d3179ebc72","amp;dn":"Damages.S05E01.AHDTV.x264.AAC-MOMENTUM.avi+%28AAC+audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a5f25b66cc686014c71adb3e267e4d3179ebc72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,95,37,182,108,198,134,1,76,113,173,179,226,103,228,211,23,158,188,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
