Not anymore. But what if we could turn back time, to the days of the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker? The story of the rise and fall of the great British high street is brought to life in an entertaining and ambitious new series that transports four empty shops and a group of modern shopkeepers and their families back to the birth of the high street in the 1870s, before propelling them through a century of dizzying change, right up to the 1970s. Over six hours of gripping television, the families lives are turned upside down as they experience how shopkeepers lived and worked in six key eras of British history. But this High Street is no museum. The shops must serve modern day customers who are used to the pace and convenience of 21st century shopping. In a challenge laced with real-life entertainment, family drama and human endeavour, can the families deal with whatever history throws at them? And can they lure shoppers back?\n\n\n\n\n4)  World War Two \nIn this episode they and their customers are thrown into World War Two and for the first time profit isn't everything. The shopkeepers find themselves dealing with rationing, promoting make do and mend and trying to persuade an entire town to pull together as it would have done sixty years ago. The grocer family struggle with wartime rules and regulations and customers have to decide whether to stick to rations or to buy from the black market. The bakers feed the town from their British restaurant while the butcher promotes mutton to modern shoppers. The dressmaker and the blacksmith convince the town of the benefits of 1940s style recycling. But shortages, an air raid and hungry customers all take their toll; will they keep the town onside in the run up to the VE day celebrations at the end of the week?\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/2323/thehighstreetscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/2323/thehighstreetscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/2633/thehighstreetscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/2633/thehighstreetscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/6963/thehighstreetscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/6963/thehighstreetscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/7945/thehighstreetscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/7945/thehighstreetscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/4961/thehighstreetscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/4961/thehighstreetscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/8330/thehighstreetscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/8330/thehighstreetscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/7234/thehighstreetscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/7234/thehighstreetscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6960/thehighstreetscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6960/thehighstreetscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/7429/thehighstreetscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/7429/thehighstreetscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/7994/thehighstreetscreen9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/7994/thehighstreetscreen9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6638/thehighstreetscreen10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6638/thehighstreetscreen10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/88/thehighstreetscreen11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/88/thehighstreetscreen11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1603 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source : DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sheptonmallet.co/turnbacktime.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sheptonmallet.co/turnbacktime.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c222457adabd8bbc7e3ee121ac64342a7e0595bd","amp;dn":"BBC+Turn+Back+Time+The+High+Street+4of6+World+War+Two+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c222457adabd8bbc7e3ee121ac64342a7e0595bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,34,69,122,218,189,139,188,126,62,225,33,172,100,52,42,126,5,149,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
