The show informs on skepticism and critical thinking, and features discussions of myths, conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, the paranormal, and many general forms of woo-woo, from the point of view of scientific skepticism. The show also features discussions of recent scientific developments in layman's terms, and interviews authors, people in the area of science and other famous skeptics as well as paranormalists.\n\nThese are episodes 101 through 200 of the show, originally aired between 2007 and 2009. All episodes are available for free download on the website, www.theskepticsguide.org, but this torrent allows for easier download.
