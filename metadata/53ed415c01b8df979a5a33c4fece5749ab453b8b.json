The program's basic features and simple interface make copying movies a snap.\n\nThe program's interface is plain and intuitive, and it more or less walks you through each step of the process. Insert the source DVD and select whether you want the entire contents or just the main movie, and chose D5, D9, or a custom format. The program then quickly copies the selected files to your computer. Once that's done, the program takes users through the process of burning the movie to the new disc. The whole process is quite simple, and even people who aren't particularly computer savvy should have little trouble getting the hang of it.
