Some of the basic features include full unicode support, ReplayGain support and native support for several popular audio formats. Foobar2000 isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just for early adopters or software jukebox fetishists. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mess with fancy buttons or bright colors, instead preferring a utilitarian, straightforward user interface to let the music speak for itself. foobar2000 uses tabs and panels to help the user navigate its plain, but functional, user interface. You can customize the interface using several layout options. Menu options and recognizable command buttons reside at the top of the window. Two panels, each with tabbed menus, reside on the left side of the window. From there, you can view the album list and the properties of a selected artist or song. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also find tabs for viewing a spectrogram, a spectrum, and VU meter of music currently being played, display album art, and synchronize with portable players including iPods.\n\nMain features:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Supported audio formats: MP3, MP4, AAC, CD Audio, WMA, Vorbis, FLAC, WavPack, WAV, AIFF, Musepack, Speex, AU, SNDÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and more with additional components.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Gapless playback.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Full unicode support.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Easily customizable user interface layout.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Advanced tagging capabilities.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Support for ripping Audio CDs as well as transcoding all supported audio formats using the Converter component.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Full ReplayGain support.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Customizable keyboard shortcuts.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Open component architecture allowing third-party developers to extend functionality of the player.\n\nOperating System:  Windows XP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ SP2 or newer, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008.\n\nChanges in foobar2000 1.1.15:\n* Added basic MusicBrainz tagging capability to the audio CD ripper.\n* Worked-around shell integration incompatibility with Windows 8.\n\n\n                                  By bobiras2009\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a13ed6f2a122833c1a3654f2eb7ae0f6786066c8","amp;dn":"foobar2000+1.1.14a+Final+%2B+1.1.15+Beta+1%5BWindows%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a13ed6f2a122833c1a3654f2eb7ae0f6786066c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,62,214,242,161,34,131,60,26,54,84,242,235,122,224,246,120,96,102,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
