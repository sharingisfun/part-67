It collects most of the material from the first volume of Woodring's Jim magazine, including color reproductions of the covers of the four issues, plus four pages of new material in full color. It includes an introduction by Mark Martin, with whom he was producing the series Tantalizing Stories at the time.\n\nThe cover of the book contains the byline, &quot;The punitively memorable best from Jim Woodring's notorious autojournal.&quot;\n\nThe book ranked #71 on The Comics Journal's list of the 100 best comics of the century.\n\nThe book is a collection of different short pieces, mostly in black and white. Most of the comics are based on Woodring's own dreams, translated verbatim into comics from his dream journal. The stories have been described as &quot;autobiographical&quot;, though they are not strictly based on events from Woodring's waking life.\n\nSeveral of the pieces (&quot;Tales of Bears&quot;, &quot;The Hour of the Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Screechy Peachy&quot;, &quot;Horse Sinister&quot;, &quot;Dinosaur Cage&quot;, &quot;When the Lobster Whistles on the Hill&quot;, &quot;Good Medicine&quot;, &quot;My Dreamhouse&quot;) are prose pieces, most of which are illustrated. They are written in an automatic, stream of consciousness style that can be bewildering and disturbing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a01a14b1f48e69abdf2867fd88b6960c44956c69","amp;dn":"Jim+Woodring+-+Jim+V1+The+Book+of+Jim+%28Fantagraphics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a01a14b1f48e69abdf2867fd88b6960c44956c69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,26,20,177,244,142,105,171,223,40,103,253,136,182,150,12,68,149,108,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
