They raid a private residence to bust an illegal mahjong game, casually abuse a pickpocket accused of throwing away evidence, and berate a confession out of a scrap collector working without a permit. The police switch between precise investigative procedure, explosions of violent fury, and moments of comic ineptitude, all captured incredibly before the camera.\n\nA prime example of how independent documentaries are on the vanguard of Chinese cinema, Crime and Punishment is an unprecedented look at the everyday workings of law enforcement in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest authoritarian society. With penetrating camerawork, Zhao Liang (Petition, 2009 Cannes Film Festival) patiently reveals the police methods used to interrogate and coerce suspects to confess crimes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the consequences when such techniques backfire. With a cold, objective eye, ZhaoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s artistry withholds judgement in this cinematic slice of reality.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcd8267ffaaf1c3f13a770e6edd7826f5b5983f7","amp;dn":"Crime+and+Punishment+%28Zui+Yu+Fa%29+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcd8267ffaaf1c3f13a770e6edd7826f5b5983f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,216,38,127,250,175,28,63,19,167,112,230,237,215,130,111,91,89,131,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
