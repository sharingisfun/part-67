So\nlet's get something straight: Its not okay for Ja Rule to\nget a hottie R&amp;B singer to sing the chorus, but 50 can\nsing his own choruses?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56ccd42fbf6b0b73e32b79d5393c04f9f8aa7826","amp;dn":"50_Cent-Amusement_Park-%28Promo_CDS%29-2007-SAW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56ccd42fbf6b0b73e32b79d5393c04f9f8aa7826","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,204,212,47,191,107,11,115,227,43,121,213,57,60,4,249,248,170,120,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
