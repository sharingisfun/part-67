This changes are in preparation for the soon to be available color profiles system (which will much look alike the kernel backup system but for color stuff). You need to re-set the colors after this update or they won't persist on reboot what-so-ever. If you find any bug please post in the XDA kernel thread or email me before leaving 1 star ratings.\n\n\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6d27a8159e09ea9e351921f2885a8358c218070","amp;dn":"Franco+Kernel+Updater+6.2+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6d27a8159e09ea9e351921f2885a8358c218070","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,210,122,129,89,224,158,169,227,81,146,31,40,133,168,53,140,33,128,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
