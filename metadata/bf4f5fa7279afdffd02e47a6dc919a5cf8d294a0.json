This is history through personality - the tangled relationships through which paint a picture of one of the most turbulent periods of the modern age. Viewers will be upstairs at the White House, not in the Cabinet Room. Through iconic events in history - the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the civil rights struggle, the mob connection - viewers will learn about the lesser known, yet critical personal stories. \n\nStarring Greg Kinnear, Barry Pepper, Katie Holmes. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf4f5fa7279afdffd02e47a6dc919a5cf8d294a0","amp;dn":"The.Kennedys.Complete.480p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf4f5fa7279afdffd02e47a6dc919a5cf8d294a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,79,95,167,39,154,253,255,208,46,71,166,220,145,154,92,248,210,148,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
