It first appears that she made a spectacular rescue of a downed helicopter crew, then held her own crew together to fight off the Iraqis after her copter crashed. Lt. Colonel Serling, who is struggling with his own demons from Desert Storm is assigned to investigate and award her the Medal of Honor. But some conflicting accounts, from her crew and soldiers in the area, cause him to question whether she deserves it.\n\nStars:\nDenzel Washington\nMeg Ryan\nLou Diamond Phillips\nMichael Moriarty\nMatt Damon\n\nXvid avi\n\nEnglish subs included in torrent\n\n\nPlease do not hit and run.
