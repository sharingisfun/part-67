From the first hour through the last, the series provides a detailed visual and oral account of the war that changed a generation and continues to color American thinking on many military and foreign policy issues.\n\nA seminal television event when it premiered as a 13-part series on PBS in 1983, Vietnam: A Television History was edited to 11 hours and rebroadcast in 1997. The series won television's top awards, including seven Emmys, the George Foster Peabody Award, the duPont/Columbia Journalism Award, the George Polk Award, two Writer's Guild Awards, and the Erik Barnouw Award of the Organization of American Historians. The duPont/Columbia jurors noted, &quot;These 13 hours of spellbinding, journalistically exemplary television have deservedly been called a landmark in American broadcast journalism and the most important and most compelling documentary series ever made. The power and importance of this series will endure.&quot;\n\n01 - Roots of a War (1945-1953)\n02 - America's Mandarin (1954-1963)\n03 - LBJ Goes to War (1964-1965)\n04 - America Takes Charge (1965-1967)\n05 - America's Enemy (1954-1967)\n06 - Tet (1968)\n07 - Vietnamizing the War (1968-1973)\n08 - Cambodia and Laos\n09 - Peace is at Hand (1968-1973)\n10 - Homefront USA\n11 - The End of the Tunnel (1973-1975)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2bce75c337ccd7a271fdf88f648540447dc21d0","amp;dn":"Vietnam+-+A+Television+History+%28American+Experience%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2bce75c337ccd7a271fdf88f648540447dc21d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,188,231,92,51,124,205,122,39,31,223,136,246,72,84,4,71,220,33,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
