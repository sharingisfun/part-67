Once you open the app you'll see a simple calculator with a swipe keyboard but there's much more behind.\n\nThis is a powerful application which has the following features:\n\n- Equation Solver: You can solve almost any equation. It supports:\n-&gt; Non-linear equations: Any type of equation, such as: 5*x+sin(x^3+2)=8 (up to 10 equations and variables, you can see 2 equations solved in the screenshots)\n-&gt; Linear equations: Like 2*x+3*y=8, -3*x+6*y=3 (up to 10)\n-&gt; Polynomials: Up to grade 20 (complex and non-complex solutions)\n\n- Interpolation\n-&gt; Simple: Perfect for thermodynamic tables with only one variable (for example Temperature)\n-&gt; Double: 2 variables interpolation. See screenshots for a preview\n-&gt; Points to line: If you have a set of points (x,y) this tool will find the closest line and will give you the R^2 (Just like Excel).\n\n- Converter: It's useful to have a converter inside the app. It's got 19 conversions: length, area, volume, angle, time, speed, acceleration, flow, mass, force, torque, energy, density, pressure, dynamic viscosity, kinematic viscosity, temperature and currency.\n\n- Wolfram Alpha search: Just touch the search button\n\n- Complex numbers: The calculator supports complex numbers in both rectangular and polar notation. Polar notation us useful for phasors in Circuit Analysis.\n\n- Variables: Just save any number as a variable and use it later.\n\n- Constants: 6, more in next updates.\n\n- Radians/degrees\n\n- Easier decimal notation: 1.000000 is 1, 99999999 is 9.999E7 (depending of the decimal precision)...\n\n- And probably more features in the future!\n\n\n                                   By bobiras2009\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d2ea8e1b0d06c7d232c9fa6ea69b468243b7fc1","amp;dn":"CalcPro+v1.1.5+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d2ea8e1b0d06c7d232c9fa6ea69b468243b7fc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,46,168,225,176,208,108,125,35,44,159,166,234,105,180,104,36,59,127,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
