Need a countdown for launching your spaceship? Want to do 200 push-ups in less than a minute or see how far you can walk on your hands in two and a half hours? Need a 12min, 48sec nap? Must re-animate the overweight guy at the pawnshop? Preparing your speech before the World Congress of Philosophy?\n\nProgram your beautiful Holo Aesthetics timer with the easiest gestures imaginable. Use it on your phone or tablet. Save an unlimited number of timers with your own labels, use and re-use them over again. Even back up your timers with your Google account.\nFor all your work and play, for everything that counts.\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Aug 23, 2012)\n\n    Dark theme\n    Improved notifications, including Jellybean optimized notifications\n    Lots and lots of bug fixes\n    Ability to use the circle to increment time values when creating a timer\n    Improved sounds\n    Resolved vibrate issues\n    Option to end all timers from the running list\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.1+\n\n\n\n\n                                  By bobiras2009\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22526ef6effdf539424d26e9ecfacfaab53e95a9","amp;dn":"Timer+v1.1+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22526ef6effdf539424d26e9ecfacfaab53e95a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,82,110,246,239,253,245,57,66,77,38,233,236,250,207,170,181,62,149,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
