Kevin recognizes they have paid their debt to society, and sees the business potential in offering them a second chance. At the end of the series, one of them will earn both Kevin's support, and his money, to start a legitimate business. This is not a handout or charity scheme; this is business.\n\nOver the 9-part series, the ex-cons will go through a series of tough and revealing challenges, that will test, demonstrate and improve their natural abilities, and expose their character flaws, gradually moving them away from their illegal past and ever closer to a legal enterprise of their own. Each challenge is designed to reveal a particular skill set - from marketing and selling, to their ability to lead and work as a team.\n\nAfter each challenge, Kevin will offer the ex-con deemed to be the weakest performer an exit package to help kick-start a new and improved life. He or she can take the package, which may include scholarships, training, computer equipment and life coaching, or opt to stay on the show and fight for the ultimate prize. Helping Kevin assess the participants is Brian O'Dea, a former ex-con, businessman and community activist who once operated a $100 million a year drug smuggling ring and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nOver this transformative series, a single candidate will emerge who is judged most likely to succeed in running their own entrepreneurial business. Their future will receive an extraordinary jumpstart with investment money to launch their own dream business venture.
