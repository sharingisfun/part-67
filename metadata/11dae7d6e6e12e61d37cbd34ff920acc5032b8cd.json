So - this torrent is the answer to your prayers.\n\nRequirements: A 8 GB USB Stick\n\nInstructions:\n\nTorrent contains 2 files - mlosx86.iso and ImageWriter.exe\n\nLaunch ImageWriter.exe ... on the bottom it will probably already have recognized and selected your USB stick, hit select ... now the &quot;hard part&quot; lol - it allows you to select only files with the extension &quot;.RAW&quot; ... either rename mlosx86.iso to mlosx86.raw or - easier just type in the select field *.iso ... this will allow you to select the mlosx86.iso as it is (recommended) \n\nNow wait until the write process is finished ... after that you can reboot your system and select the USB stick and just boot from it.\n\nWhat I have posted here has been tested on Windows 7 with an entirely empty USB stick ... write completed perfectly ... reboot was fine as was the installation from the USB stick. If you guys have any problems and/or questions - come and join me on http://www.mlosx86.com. Cheers.\n\nCredits for the UniBeast creator go as usual to TonyMacX86 &amp; MacMan\n\nPete\t\t\n\nMy first torrent upload failed ue to misconfiguration on my machine, this one should work - deleting the old one :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11dae7d6e6e12e61d37cbd34ff920acc5032b8cd","amp;dn":"OS+X+10.8+ML+USB+Stick+Creator+%28UniBeast+1.5.3%29+for+Windows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11dae7d6e6e12e61d37cbd34ff920acc5032b8cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,218,231,214,230,225,46,97,211,124,189,52,255,146,10,204,80,50,184,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
