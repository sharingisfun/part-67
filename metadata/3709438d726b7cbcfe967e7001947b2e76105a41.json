This show is from the Balance Tour (aka the &quot;Ambulance Tour&quot; due to Eddie and Alex's numerous medical issues during that tour).  This concert was also the opening night of the tour, and was partially shown on MTV as part of their Spring Break '95 coverage at the time.  A great, spirited performance from the band and awesome, official release quality sound make this a must-have.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3709438d726b7cbcfe967e7001947b2e76105a41","amp;dn":"Van+Halen+-+1995-03-11+-+Civic+Center+in+Pensacola%2C+FL++SBD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3709438d726b7cbcfe967e7001947b2e76105a41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,9,67,141,114,107,124,188,254,150,126,112,1,148,123,46,118,16,90,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
