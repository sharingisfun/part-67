Drawing heavily from 20th century Israeli history, the Zionist movement, several Old Testament passages, and his own personal experience in Israel, Fletcher argues that God's support of the modern state of Israel as the restored kingdom foretold in the prophets is indisputable. Approximately 30 minutes in length. \n\nGary DeMar: Arguing in the Negative\nIn his opening statement, American Vision President Gary DeMar weaves a cohesive argument from scripture and history, demonstrating the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in times past, the misapplication of New Testament images by premillenial commentators, and the confusion that ensues when the modern Israel package deal is forced on the Scriptures. Approximately 30 minutes in length.\n\nSpecifications: 2 DVDs, 1 Debate (120 minutes)\n\nAlso inlcudes two Bonus Lectures on Ezekiel 38 &amp; 39 by Gary DeMar (79 minutes) \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.americanvision.com/Modern-Israel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.americanvision.com/Modern-Israel&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a133bdb99da37ff513061a8140918cd6ca4d4f38","amp;dn":"Is+Modern+Israel+A+Fulfillment+Of+BiblicalProphecy+%3F+%282010%29+Divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a133bdb99da37ff513061a8140918cd6ca4d4f38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,51,189,185,157,163,127,245,19,6,26,129,64,145,140,214,202,77,79,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
