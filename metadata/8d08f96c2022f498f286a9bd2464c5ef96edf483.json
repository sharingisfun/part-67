More than 23 million people suffer from diabetes in the U.S. alone. Ali expertly covers the causes, treatment, and early and later symptoms. (The first signs are excessive thirst, urination, and appetite. \n\nLater, people can suffer from erectile dysfunction, acne, headaches, and cramps.) Ali also explains the diseaseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind-boggling alphabet-acronym soup: BMI, SMBG, DCCT, NP, DKA. Rather than blaming type 2 diabetics for sufferersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ condition, which is often brought on by obesity, Ali tries to motivate them to exercise and lose weight. He also includes a thorough glossary (whoever heard of GoodpastureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s syndrome?) and several pages with contact information for research groups, diabetes centers and clinics, and other resources. His advice isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always earthshaking; learn portion size, keep a food diary, eat more fruits and vegetables, quit smoking. But it may be lifesaving. --Karen Springen\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d08f96c2022f498f286a9bd2464c5ef96edf483","amp;dn":"Diabetes+and+You+A+Comprehensive%2C+Holistic+Approach.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d08f96c2022f498f286a9bd2464c5ef96edf483","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,8,249,108,32,34,244,152,242,134,169,189,36,100,197,239,150,237,244,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
