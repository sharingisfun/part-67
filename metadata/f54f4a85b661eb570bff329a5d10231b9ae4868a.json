It's an animal with eight sucker-covered arms growing out of its head, three hearts pumping its blue-green blood, and a doughnut-shaped brain. It has the ability to change its color and shape to blend in with seaweed and rocks, and it has a knack for switching on electrifying light shows that dazzle its prey. Perhaps most surprising of all, this animal is quite intelligent, with a highly complex brain. In this program, underwater cameras capture the extraordinary powers of the cuttlefish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f54f4a85b661eb570bff329a5d10231b9ae4868a","amp;dn":"Nova+%28PBS%29+Cuttlefish+-+Kings+of+Camouflage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f54f4a85b661eb570bff329a5d10231b9ae4868a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,79,74,133,182,97,235,87,11,255,50,154,93,16,35,27,154,228,134,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
