His background is that of a renaissance man with a background in three professions, plus having various books published in religions, philosophy, poetry, mainly under pseudonyms. For much of his life (for main income) he was heavily involved in the music industry as a singer/songwriter/session-musician.\n\nBorn in Scotland, he watched the subtleties of politics and media as they guided the population of the U.K. covertly into a European Amalgamation. He has been warning the North American people for some years now that the same process of amalgamation is being carried out.\n\nWith historical documentation, he shows how cultures are created and altered by those in control, always to lead the people like sheep into the next pasture.\n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d29a65969f0d1f93f8b046cf0ddb6793b00c464","amp;dn":"Cutting+Through+the+Matrix+-+2012+Mar+14+WE+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d29a65969f0d1f93f8b046cf0ddb6793b00c464","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,41,166,89,105,240,209,249,63,139,4,108,240,221,182,121,59,0,196,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
