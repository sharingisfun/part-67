How comes?\nA: Uninstall the Lite version before installing the Pro version. Try to change settings. Increase upload speed, it may increase download speed as well.\nQ: I have force restarts, my device slows down etc. What's this crap?\nA: You use Ice Cream Sandwich probably. Then you have no luck. We can't guarantee, that it works for you, because we can't support custom ICS ROMs. Use another OS. ICS is still not available for many devices.\nQ: All torrents are corrupted. What the heck?\nA: You try to download from a tracker, which needs to be logged in with an account. Log in to your account on that tracker or download the files from another tracker.\nQ: Why I need to download another app from outside to use this?\nA: You need to download the search plugin to be able to search from inside the app. If you don't download it, you still can search for torrents within your internet browser.\nIn case of doubt try the Lite version first!\n[img]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj629/sameer_ecs/37.jpg[/img][img]http://i1271.photobucket.com/albums/jj629/sameer_ecs/38.jpg[/img]\nGive feedback &amp; Do comment ....![/color]\n[b]Download enjoy and share the happiness to others by seeding[/b]\n[img]http://www.naturalbd.com/torrentimg/s3733766a37d1c091b59c253e8e582e8e293074d38.gif[/img]\n[img]http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/3886/blah1m.png[/img]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:229992d7c561239a95011f784d01e193441be262","amp;dn":"Ttorrent+Pro+V1.0%7BECS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"229992d7c561239a95011f784d01e193441be262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,153,146,215,197,97,35,154,149,1,31,120,77,1,225,147,68,27,226,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
