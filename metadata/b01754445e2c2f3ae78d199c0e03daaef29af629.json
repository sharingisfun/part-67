The whole movie is a sad, sad satire of Bucharest getto natives' attitude towards life, society.\n\nHoratiu Malaiele plays a tire repairman who is a degenerate alcoholic on a very steep social/financial downslope, facing a divorce, etc. The movie contains a miriad of gross scenes, would easily be rated NC-17 in America. This is a window on the post - December mahala reality of the Romanian capitol. Definitely eye-opening to those unaware of that reality. Otherwise plain gross and very very objective. I reccomend watching this movie if you're 40 or more years of age and have some tights in the Balcans, especially if you're an ex political reffugee.\n\nby anonimi64 (Iowa)\n\nVideo: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 5474kbps\nAudio: Romanian DD 5.1\nSubtitle: English\nMenu: Yes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b01754445e2c2f3ae78d199c0e03daaef29af629","amp;dn":"Aceasta+lehamite+1994+PAL+DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b01754445e2c2f3ae78d199c0e03daaef29af629","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,23,84,68,94,44,47,58,231,141,25,156,14,3,218,174,242,154,246,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
