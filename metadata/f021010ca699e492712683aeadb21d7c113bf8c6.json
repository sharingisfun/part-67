Within the pages of this book, you will be introduced to and get to know all the parts of your bike.\n\n You will learn which components perform what functions, and you will learn how they all come together to make your bicycle work.\n Tools and supplies will be explained, lending you insight as to which ones you will need and what, though perhaps less necessary, can improve the speed, accuracy and ease of each repair. Then, you will take all of this together and discover how all those bits and pieces are kept in top working order by cleaning, inspecting, lubricating and adjusting.\n If you need to service your suspension, bleed your hydraulics, adjust your gears, or true your wheels but don't know a headset from a bottom bracket, this book will take you through, step-by-step. It will even tell you how to keep oil off the carpet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f021010ca699e492712683aeadb21d7c113bf8c6","amp;dn":"Bicycling+Magazine%27s+Illustrated+Bicycle+Maintenance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f021010ca699e492712683aeadb21d7c113bf8c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,33,1,12,166,153,228,146,113,38,131,174,173,178,29,124,17,59,248,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
