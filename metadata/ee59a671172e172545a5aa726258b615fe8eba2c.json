And while thought to have been extinct for hundreds of years, wolves indeed still walk the Earth...hidden among mankind. Now, a group of outcast wolves set out to find Paradise: Kiba, Hige, Toboe and Tsume. Each wolf is driven by their own personality and desires, but together they are pursued by humans seeking to quench their own thirst for power. A difficult and long journey lies ahead, with Paradise waiting to be found.\n\nDISC 01\n\n1. Streetcorner of Howls\n2. Dry-eyed Toboe\n3. Bad Fellow\n4. Scar of Wilderness\n5.
