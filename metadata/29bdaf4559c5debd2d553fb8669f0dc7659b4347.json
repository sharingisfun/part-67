Trumbull instead shot the virtual reality sequences in 24 frame/s Super Panavision 70 with an aspect ratio of 2.2:1. The rest of the film was shot in conventional 35mm with an aspect ratio of approximately 1.7 to 1\n\n\nNo Change in Audio &amp; Video Quality!!!!\n\n\nZ3R0 Release!!!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29bdaf4559c5debd2d553fb8669f0dc7659b4347","amp;dn":"BRAINSTORM%2A%2A1983%2A%2ADVD+to+MKV%2A%2ARemastered%2A%2AZ3R0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29bdaf4559c5debd2d553fb8669f0dc7659b4347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,189,175,69,89,197,222,189,45,85,63,184,102,159,13,199,101,155,67,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
