It traces the development of dramatic art through the miracle plays, the great Shakespearean period, Moliere and Racine in France, Goethe in Germany, through the 19th century and the main movements in the 20th century. It is illustrated by numerous examples of differing styles, with some historical recordings as well and excerpts from nearly 50 plays. A fascinating journey. It is written by David Timson, the British actor and director who features extensively on Naxos Audiobooks in both roles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2f4b504c830720be35e74189d91a06b8dc05c71","amp;dn":"The+History+of+Theatre+-+David+Timson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2f4b504c830720be35e74189d91a06b8dc05c71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,244,181,4,200,48,114,11,227,94,116,24,157,145,160,107,141,192,92,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
