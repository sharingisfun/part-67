Yet when it comes to fungi, culinary uses are only the tip of the iceberg. Throughout history fungus has been prized for its diverse propertiesÃ¢â‚¬â€medicinal, ecological, even recreationalÃ¢â‚¬â€and has spawned its own quirky subculture dedicated to exploring the weird biology and celebrating the unique role it plays on earth. In Mycophilia, accomplished food writer and cookbook author Eugenia Bone examines the role of fungi as exotic delicacy, curative, poison, and hallucinogen, and ultimately discovers that a greater understanding of fungi is key to facing many challenges of the 21st century.\nEngrossing, surprising, and packed with up-to-date science and cultural exploration, Mycophilia is part narrative and part primer for foodies, science buffs, environmental advocates, and anyone interested in learning a lot about one of the least understood and most curious organisms in nature.\n\nAbout the Author\nEUGENIA BONE is an author and a food writer who has been featured in numerous national publications. She writes a blog on preserving foods for the Denver Post. She lives in New York City.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:859f7e011dd75615c045b63b04ce1293a3cd72d3","amp;dn":"Mycophilia+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"859f7e011dd75615c045b63b04ce1293a3cd72d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,159,126,1,29,215,86,21,192,69,182,59,4,206,18,147,163,205,114,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
