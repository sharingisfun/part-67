This film captures a never-before-seen, intimate look at a trailblazer for both women and comedy. Miss Diller provides unprecedented access to her preparations for her final performance at the Suncoast Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. \n\nThe film intimately captures her press conference, rehearsal and candid conversations in her dressing room prior to taking the stage for the very last time. This historical and hysterical farewell performance acts as the thread to the film, proving why her talents have endured for decades and resulted in a worldwide loyal fan base. With all-new original footage, the documentary gives the audience a deeper appreciation of Diller's influence on yesterday's and today's cutting-edge comedians. \n\nDiller opens her heart and her home as she takes audiences on a private guided tour of her beloved estate. She takes cameras into the &quot;Bob Hope Salon&quot;; the famous &quot;Wig Room&quot;; her kitchen, the &quot;Scarlet Scullery&quot;; her vast wardrobe collection; an art studio; and her personal office. During the tour, Diller shows off her talent and passion as a painter, gourmet chef and even a concert pianist.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431092/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431092/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/25421/goodnight-we-love-you-the-life-and-legend-of-phyllis-diller/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/25421/goodnight-we-love-you-the-life-and-legend-of-phyllis-diller/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shoestring.org/mmi_revs/goodnightwelove-hc-219439909.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shoestring.org/mmi_revs/goodnightwelove-hc-219439909.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/goodnightweloveyou.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/goodnightweloveyou.php&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodnightweloveyou.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodnightweloveyou.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDVDrip with MEgui\nRip Specs:\n      Format : AVI\n      File size : 1.04 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 31mn\n      Overall bit rate mode : Variable\n      Overall bit rate : 1 629 Kbps\n   Video #0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Advanced Simple@L5\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Bit rate : 1 499 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 400 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.174\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 \n   Audio #1\n      Codec ID : MP3\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 116 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Writing library : LAME3.99r\n\nNext upload will be the full uncut final performance, included as an extra on this DVD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba484619c86543ec8feb7d17744b65711a04b2f5","amp;dn":"Goodnight%2C+We+Love+You+-+Life+and+Legend+of+Phyllis+Diller+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba484619c86543ec8feb7d17744b65711a04b2f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,72,70,25,200,101,67,236,143,235,125,23,116,75,101,113,26,4,178,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
