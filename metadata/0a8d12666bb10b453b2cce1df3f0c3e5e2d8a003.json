A fairly straight-forward version of the yarn, it features a splendid performance from Dan O'Herlihy, whose carries most of the film alone - and won an Oscar nomination as Best Actor for his work (but lost to Brando's Terry Malloy.) Although this is considered a &quot;restoration,&quot; the film is not all one would like it to be - the film was hastily shot in inferior Pathe color, and some of the work looks less than professional calibre. Still, it's a fast-paced version of this &quot;ripping yarn,&quot; one that forcefully engages the viewer in castaway Crusoe's triumphs and tragedies in his quest for survival.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a8d12666bb10b453b2cce1df3f0c3e5e2d8a003","amp;dn":"Adventures+of+Robinson+Crusoe+%281954%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a8d12666bb10b453b2cce1df3f0c3e5e2d8a003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,141,18,102,107,177,11,69,59,44,206,29,243,240,195,229,226,216,160,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
