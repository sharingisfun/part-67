If you are new to Mobilism and this is your first time here, read this (its short, don't worry) to clear things up about who we are and what we do.\n\nCurrently supported for direct downloading:\n-\n-\n- megashare.com\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nHow it works:\nWith the premium system your file is downloaded onto a server using a shared filehost premium account, and then a direct download sent back to you. With small files such as apks, the process generally takes less than ten seconds. This is a premium feature and since we need to pay for the premium accounts we charge a fee for a year of subscription.\n\n\nChangelog v1.8:\n- bugfix that caused crashing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65e1877737dd8e792ed708b5a79c936d6844e4e1","amp;dn":"Mobilism+Market+v1.8+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65e1877737dd8e792ed708b5a79c936d6844e4e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,225,135,119,55,221,142,121,46,215,8,181,167,156,147,109,104,68,228,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
