In this 4th edition, new information about membrane transporters, signal transduction proteins, mitochondrial respiratory complexes, and the DNA replication and protein synthesis machinery. New experimental approaches for studying complex systems are introduced, including the DNA pyrosequencing technique, metagenomics, atomic force microscopy, genome-wide disease association studies, DNA polymorphisms in genealogy, and the role of microRNAs in gene regulation. Notes on a variety of human diseases and pharmacological effectors have been expanded to reflect recent research findings.\nThis ia a DJVU with OCR &amp; bookmarks. There are 1200 pages in 17 mb!
