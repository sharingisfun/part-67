Leaves fall, and spirits rise from the fallen leaves to begin their journey home. You must guide them, without direct control, by changing how the wind blows or by rebuilding the ground.\n\nEach spirit can be sacrificed to perform one of four actions - build a bridge of leaves, create a blowing cloud, dig tunnels, or block wind currents in an area. Use your actions wisely or you will run out of spirits. In each level it's up to you to find your own creative solution on how to get the spirits to the goal.\n\nWhat's in this version: (Updated : Aug 16, 2012)\n\n    Fixed level selection on Motorola Xoom tablets\n    Fixed suspend/resume when not using lock screen\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.2+\t\n\n\n\n                                  By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bb7f13e0fc68d58747bad040cadedcb71e5b477","amp;dn":"Spirits+v1.0.3+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bb7f13e0fc68d58747bad040cadedcb71e5b477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,183,241,62,15,198,141,88,116,123,173,4,12,173,237,203,113,229,180,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
