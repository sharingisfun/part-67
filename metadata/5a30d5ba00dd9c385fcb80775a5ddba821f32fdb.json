Under the cover of preparations for the upcoming\nDemon invasion, he plots to recover his powers and take control of\nAshan while eradicating his ancient enemies. He underestimates,\nhowever, the power of the all-too-human Griffin dynasty...\n\nHeroes VI tells the story of the Griffin dynasty, when they were still\nDukes of the Holy Empire, and not yet sitting on the Imperial throne\n(like in Heroes 5 and Clash of Heroes). The Griffin Duchy is east of\nthe Empire, a region that would correspond to the Slavic nations in our\nown world.\n\nAt the dynastys origins, The Griffin Duke Pavel was a zealous servant\nof the Light and a trusted lieutenant of the Falcon Emperor. He met his\ndemise defending his own duchy from a Demon host summoned by the dying\nwish of a desperate enemy. Pavel's heroic last stand would ensure the\nsurvival of his son, Slava, who was only a boy at the time of these\nevents.\n\nPavel's sister Sveltana, who had left her homeland to become a\nprominent Necromancer in the Seven Cities, was called back to act as\nregent to Slava and educate him in the ways of the Griffin.\n\nFifteen years and a war have past. Duke Slava of Griffin is now the\nfather of five promising children. These are the main Heroes of the\nHeroes 6 campaign, and they will lead different factions to battle.\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n2.
