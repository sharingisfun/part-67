The turn-of-the-century hotel is known for its rough and seedy past Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the doors to its rooms sealed 50 years ago following a series of gruesome murders Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and local lore says itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s haunted. Despite the reservations of family and friends, an undaunted Grace takes up residence in the eerie inn to immerse herself in writing. But now that the doors are open, the secrets of the past begin to emerge. As disturbing, but seemingly explicable, events begin to escalate, Grace struggles to define reality from insanity and begins a descent into darkness from which some will never return\n\nGenre: Horror\nIMDB Rating: 3.2/10 from 57 users\nDirected by: Bruce Koehler\nStarring: Natalie Bail, Norm Wash and Bryan Koehler\n\nRelease Name: 19.Doors.2011.DVDRip.XViD-DOCUMENT\nSize: 700 MB\nVideo: AVI | 640Ãƒâ€”288 | 1034 kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 140 kbps\nRuntime: 82 MIN\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cbb7d28b0af8d08ba84d61b51106220e2ec9cd4","amp;dn":"19.Doors.2011.DVDRip.XviD-DOCUMENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cbb7d28b0af8d08ba84d61b51106220e2ec9cd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,187,125,40,176,175,141,8,186,132,214,27,81,16,98,32,226,236,156,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
