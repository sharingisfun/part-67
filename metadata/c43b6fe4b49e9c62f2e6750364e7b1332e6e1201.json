DP 34 was only a 3CD set that could have crowbarred in at least this show's Sunrise and Good Lovin' along with Ship of Fools, Scarlet &gt; Fire, and Terrapin Station on a fourth disc.\n\nI apologize for the single track for Scarlet&gt;Fire and a couple of the others.  That's how I received it and I didn't want to alter it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c43b6fe4b49e9c62f2e6750364e7b1332e6e1201","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1977-11-02+-+Field+House%2C+Seneca+College+in+Toro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c43b6fe4b49e9c62f2e6750364e7b1332e6e1201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,59,111,228,180,158,156,98,242,230,117,3,100,231,177,51,46,110,18,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
