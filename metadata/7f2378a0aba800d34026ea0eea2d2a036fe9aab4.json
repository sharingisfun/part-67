A season of great games, glorious goals and unbelievable results that ended with the Gunners overtaking neighbours Spurs to claim third place and ensure their status as London s number one club. It means a 15th successive season qualifying for the Champions League and 17 years since Tottenham last finished above Arsenal.\nThere have been few seasons like this in the club's proud 125 year history. A thrilling 5-3 win at Chelsea; a formidable 5-2 triumph over Tottenham; the magnificent 7-1 wonder show against Blackburn; and the heroic 3-0 victory over Milan. The feel good factor's back at Arsenal. Leading from the front has been captain fantastic Robin van Persie, smashing in 37 goals in all competitions many of them absolutely breathtaking.\nHe topped it off with double Player of the Year awards, recognised as the best by both his fellow players and the football writers. Arsene Wenger has once again proved there is no one better at discovering exciting talent with England's newest whizz kid Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain bursting on to the scene. \nAnd there was even a blast from the past with legend Thierry Henry enjoying a second spell at the club, reminding everyone what a genius he is. Featuring every goal from every game. The perfect record of a landmark season that will live long in the memory of every Gooner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f2378a0aba800d34026ea0eea2d2a036fe9aab4","amp;dn":"Arsenal+Season+Review+2011%2F12+DVDRip+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f2378a0aba800d34026ea0eea2d2a036fe9aab4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,35,120,160,171,168,0,211,64,38,234,14,234,45,42,3,111,233,170,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
