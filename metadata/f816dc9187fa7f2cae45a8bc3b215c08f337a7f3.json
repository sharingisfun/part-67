One moment the Baltimore-born art-pop outfit might put out a widely hailed touchstone like Merriweather Post Pavilion, the next a droning droning Record Store Day 12&quot; likely to drive away casual fans. Both aspects of Animal Collective can be found on the two sides of the band's upcoming 7&quot; single, due out June 26 on Domino but streaming now, with production by the group and previous studio collaborator Ben Allen (Gnarls Barkley, Deerhunter).\n\nA-side &quot;Honeycomb&quot; has cartoon-like sound effects, bouncy electronic blips and bloops, and yawping vocals that appear to be conveying optimistic lyrics Ã¢â‚¬â€ something about the &quot;impossible places&quot; you can go in &quot;your life&quot; (shouts to Dr. Seuss?). B-side &quot;Gotham,&quot; accompanied by black-and-white artwork, is more guitar-driven but also harder to grab hold of, a slow-paced psych-pop ballad washed out by distortion. We kid about Animal Collective's studio process, but this first non-RSD single from the group in a hot minute offers few clues toward the direction of the long-awaited follow-up to Merriweather Post Pavilion.\n\nDon't forget to seed!
