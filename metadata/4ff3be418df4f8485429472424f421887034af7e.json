(Constantine was knowingly paraphrasing the title of Alfred Lord Tennyson's famous &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, about a reckless military event.)\n\nThey first appeared together in Neil Gaiman's The Books of Magic series, in which they attempted to guide Tim Hunter through various realms of Magic in the DC Universe in order to teach him all of Magic's abilities and consequences.\n\nThe group would later re-unite in the five-issue mini-series The Names of Magic, before finally getting their own mini-series.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ff3be418df4f8485429472424f421887034af7e","amp;dn":"The+Trenchcoat+Brigade+%28Vertigo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ff3be418df4f8485429472424f421887034af7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,243,190,65,141,244,248,72,84,41,71,36,36,244,33,136,112,52,175,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
