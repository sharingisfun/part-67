This workshop from leading Photoshop expert Tim Grey will dispel many myths and misunderstandings about sharpening, teach you the underlying concepts involved in sharpening, show you a wide variety of methods you can use to apply sharpening, and help you determine which technique is best for a given image. In addition to PhotoshopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s native sharpening tools, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to make use of the options available in Lightroom, Adobe Camera Raw, and third-party plug-ins like Nik Sharpener Pro and PhotoKit Sharpener. The workshop concludes with several projects designed to help reinforce your knowledge of sharpening; youÃ‚Â´ll see how to apply sharpening and softening to different areas of an image, apply creative sharpening to specific areas, and sharpen a black-and-white image. \n\nInfo: http://www.video2brain.com/en/courses/photoshop-sharpening-power-workshop","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b82fafdc97fa98ab9ac202a8b9b020bb263df152","amp;dn":"Video2Brain+-+Photoshop+Sharpening+Power+Workshop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b82fafdc97fa98ab9ac202a8b9b020bb263df152","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,47,175,220,151,250,152,171,154,194,2,168,185,176,32,187,38,61,241,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
