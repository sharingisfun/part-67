It looks at a variety of approaches: artificial intelligence using neural networks, case-based reasoning, Baysian belief systems, along with a variety of imaging methods: radiological, CT, MRI and the use of imaging devices.\n\nThe methods described in this book complement, or may even replace, the less-reliable, more traditional means of securing identification by presumptive means, i.e., recognition of clothing, personal effects and clay reconstruction.\n\n- Covers cutting-edge technologies in the context of historical forensic reconstruction methods\n- Features stellar authors from around the globe\n- Bridges the areas of computer graphics, animation, and forensic anthropology\n\n\n# Hardcover: 384 pages\n# Publisher: Academic Press; 1 edition (August 29, 2005)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0124730515\n# ISBN-13: 978-0124730519","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:544435ec82ce44acf9b8934257dbd1342a880325","amp;dn":"Computer-Graphic+Facial+Reconstruction+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"544435ec82ce44acf9b8934257dbd1342a880325","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,68,53,236,130,206,68,172,249,184,147,66,87,219,209,52,42,136,3,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
