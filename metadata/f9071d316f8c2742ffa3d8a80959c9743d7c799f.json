The game features six, highly detailed locations to explore, \n   in which your alter ego should navigate a  wide  range  of  situations, \n   ranging from solving puzzles to facing the eerie presences  that  haunt \n   the surroundings.\n   \n   Depending on the mental status of your character (which  is  determined \n   by your actions),  you're  tasked  with  navigating  your  way  through \n   ever-changing places along with their  well  hidden  clues,  eventually \n   leading you to one of three possible endings.\n\n   At a budget price  tag,  the  game  itself  has  been  designed  as  an \n   interactive three-hour singleplayer horror experience.\n   \n   The OST was performed by the budding  &quot;Chantry&quot;  gothic  band,  now  on \n   their 2nd album &quot;Crystal&quot;.\n   \n   The game is a  PC  exclusive,  featuring  state-of-the-art  models  and \n   shaders that take advantage of the latest technologies available to  us \n   through the power of new developments in graphics hardware.\n\n\n   Features: \n   ~~~~~~~~~\n   * A dramatic story with three endings based  \n     on the main character's mental sanity.\n   * Real time 3D graphic with physically based rendering, tone\n     mapping, real time ambient occlusion and bloom effects.\n   * A beautiful soundtrack with some original music \n     pieces and hundreds of sound effects.\n   * An original setting in a charmining place: \n     &quot;D'Ayas Valley&quot; in Valle d'Aosta, Italy.\n\n\n   Install\n   ~~~~~~~\n   1.)
