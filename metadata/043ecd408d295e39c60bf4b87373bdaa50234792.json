That CD is the LOUDEST CD in existence, and consequently one of the worst sounding due to constant clipping and distortion.\n\nFive years later on Record Store Day 2012, a limited edition double LP of &quot;Raw Power&quot; was released. The first LP was the original David Bowie mix. The 2nd LP is the 1997 mix remastered by Kevin Gray, which now sounds a LOT better.\n\nThis is a needledrop of the 2nd LP. Not my rip, but I've converted it to 44.1KHz/16-bit from the 96kHz/24-bit files, and attenuated the noise between the songs. That's it; no automatic noise reduction was used.\n\nIggy &amp; The Stooges - Raw Power\n\n1. Search and Destroy\n2. Gimme Danger\n3. Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell\n4. Penetration\n5.
