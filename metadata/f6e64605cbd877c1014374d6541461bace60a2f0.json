Installed AC3Filter to listen to someone else's rip which had a low soundtrack. Ripped New York doc with AC3Filter still installed and discovered that it had affected the soundtrack in a way that made it sound detached. Uninstalled AC3Filter and did a new rip of New York and compared the two rips. The audio in this rip is better. \n\nThis new rip has R2 in the title to distinguish it from the earlier rip. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6e64605cbd877c1014374d6541461bace60a2f0","amp;dn":"PBS+New+York+-+Ep+8+%281946+-+2003%29+-+Documentary+%28R2%29+-+Avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6e64605cbd877c1014374d6541461bace60a2f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,230,70,5,203,216,119,193,1,67,116,214,84,20,97,186,206,96,162,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
