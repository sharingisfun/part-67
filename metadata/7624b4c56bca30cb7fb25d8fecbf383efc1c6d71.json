Kelling lays out all the basics: how to analyze your budget and costs; how to find suitable land and a livable travel trailer or RV to use as a permanent home; what kinds of tools you'll need; and how to construct a septic system, generate power, devise heating and refrigeration systems, and much more. It's incredible but true: you can head down the path to self-sufficiency and affordable living in your own home right now for under $5,000.
