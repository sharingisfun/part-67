Dark Souls is a spiritual successor to DemonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, not a sequel. Prepare for a new, despair-inducing world, with a vast, fully-explorable horizon and vertically-oriented landforms. Prepare for a new, mysterious story, centered around the the world of Lodran, but most of all, prepare to die. You will face countless murderous traps, countless darkly grotesque mobs and several gargantuan, supremely powerful demons and dragons bosses. You must learn from death to persist through this unforgiving world. And you arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t alone. Dark Souls allows the spirits of other players to show up in your world, so you can learn from their deaths and they can learn from yours. You can also summon players into your world to co-op adventure, or invade otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worlds to PVP battle. New to Dark Souls are Bonfires, which serve as check points as you fight your way through this epic adventure. While rested at Bonfires, your health and magic replenish but at a cost, all mobs respawn. Beware: There is no place in Dark Souls that is truly safe. With days of game play and an even more punishing difficulty level, Dark Souls will be the most deeply challenging game you play this year. Can you live through a million deaths and earn your legacy?\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nOS: Windows XP , Windows Vista, Windows 7, or newer\n\nCPU: 2.6 GHz Dual-Core\n\nGPU RAM: 512MB\n\nGPU: ATI Radeon 4850 or better, NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT or better\n\nRAM: 1GB (XP), 2GB (Vista/7)\n\nHDD: 4GB\n\nDX: 9.0c\n\nAUDIO: Direct Sound Compatible\n\nIn order for you to play this game you will need to follow some simply steps:\n\n1.Install Game\n2.Launch Game from desktop shortcut\n3.Create Local profile on windows live(When you will be asked to create an account, yes chouse that option, after that scrool down untill you see a text &quot;create an local account&quot;, press it and make your account\n4.PLAY GAME\n\nThis torrent it`s a full game don`t need`s crack or serial you just install it and follow the steps i provided up :)\n\nMore info and support: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.aviara.ro/forum/index.php?topic=13162.msg62155#msg62155&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.aviara.ro/forum/index.php?topic=13162.msg62155#msg62155&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like this torrent seed it to others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5f8d20cc10da3458fe18b0f1bd29b59961a19e6","amp;dn":"Dark+Souls+FULL+GAME+%28Saving+Works%29-%3DAviaRa%3D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5f8d20cc10da3458fe18b0f1bd29b59961a19e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,248,210,12,193,13,163,69,143,225,139,15,27,210,155,89,150,26,25,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
