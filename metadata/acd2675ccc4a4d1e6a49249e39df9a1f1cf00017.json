This dynamic original series dramatizes the final hour leading up to several pivotal historical events. Here we experience history just before it became history.Using a real-time clock and a split-screen to follow key players, the series reveals the chilling lead-up to events that changed the world including the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown, 9/11 and the Columbine shooting.\n\n\n\nEpisode 6 : The King of Cocaine\n\nTo some, Pablo Escobar was the greatest criminal in history. A brutal man who terrorized, tortured and murdered thousands as the billionaire king of the Columbian cocaine racket. To others he was a Robin Hood - giving back to the poor, the money made from selling drugs to the spoiled and decadent rich.\n\nHot on Escobar's trail is a father and son team. They are leading an elite squad of Colombian police that have tracked the King of Cocaine for more than five years.\n\nBased on the testimony of those who were there that day and transcripts of Escobar's telephone conversations, this programme offers an intense, second-by-second reconstruction of the Drug Lord's final hour - an hour that builds relentlessly to Escobar's bloody end in a storm of bullets.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2242 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x464\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.552:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46:41.640\nNumber Of Parts: 10\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acd2675ccc4a4d1e6a49249e39df9a1f1cf00017","amp;dn":"DC.Zero.Hour.06of10.The.King.of.Cocaine.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acd2675ccc4a4d1e6a49249e39df9a1f1cf00017","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,210,103,92,204,74,77,30,106,73,36,158,57,223,154,31,28,240,0,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
