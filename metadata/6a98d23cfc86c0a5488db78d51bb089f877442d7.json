In Red Land, Black Land, she transports us back thousands of years and immerses us in the sights, aromas, and sounds of day-to-day living in the legendary desert realm that was ancient Egypt.\n\nWho were these people whose civilization has inspired myriad films, books, artwork, myths, and dreams, and who built astonishing monuments that still stagger the imagination five thousand years later? What did average Egyptians eat, drink, wear, gossip about, and aspire to? What were their amusements, their beliefs, their attitudes concerning religion, childrearing, nudity, premarital sex? Mertz ushers us into their homes, workplaces, temples, and palaces to give us an intimate view of the everyday worlds of the royal and commoner alike. We observe priests and painters, scribes and pyramid builders, slaves, housewives, and queensÃ¢â‚¬â€and receive fascinating tips on how to perform tasks essential to ancient Egyptian living, from mummification to making papyrus.\n\nAn eye-opening and endlessly entertaining companion volume to Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs, Mertz's extraordinary history of ancient Egypt, Red Land, Black Land offers readers a brilliant display of rich description and fascinating edification. It brings us closer than ever before to the people of a great lost culture that was so different fromÃ¢â‚¬â€yet so surprisingly similar toÃ¢â‚¬â€our own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a98d23cfc86c0a5488db78d51bb089f877442d7","amp;dn":"Red+Land%2C+Black+Land","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a98d23cfc86c0a5488db78d51bb089f877442d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,152,210,60,252,134,192,165,72,141,183,141,81,187,8,159,135,116,66,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
