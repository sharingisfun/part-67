To support his extravagant lifestyle, he is also an art thief, which he does in cahoots with his friend, the gun toting Ove Kjikerud. They replace the originals with forgeries, which go undetected at least until the trail back to them goes cold. His outward bravado, based primarily on building upon reputation, masks his insecurities, especially in his short physical stature. He feels he needs that confident demeanor and wealth to get what he wants, including his trophy wife, art gallery owner Diana Brown. However, he almost seems to like the thought of what Diana represents more than Diana herself. As such, he has a mistress on the side named Lotte. The issue of having a baby Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Diana wants to get pregnant while Roger doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want her to Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is another bone of contention in their marriage. The two sides of RogerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s professional life intersect when Diana introduces him to Clas GreveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nGenre: Crime | Thriller \nIMDB rating: 7.5/10 from 17,133 users \nDirected by: Morten Tyldum \nStarring: Aksel Hennie, SynnÃƒÂ¸ve Macody Lund and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau \n\nRelease Name: Headhunters.2011.English.DUBBED.BRRip.XviD-4PlayHD \nSize: 790 MiB \nVideo: AVi | 640 x 272 | 1 103 Kbps \nAudio: English DUBBED | MP3 | 144 Kbps \nRuntime: 1hour 40minutes \nSubtitle: English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73dbedd0a22ede414d56c0c392677a24025a4f71","amp;dn":"Headhunters.2011.English.DUBBED.BRRip.XviD-4PlayHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73dbedd0a22ede414d56c0c392677a24025a4f71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,219,237,208,162,46,222,65,77,86,192,195,146,103,122,36,2,90,79,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
