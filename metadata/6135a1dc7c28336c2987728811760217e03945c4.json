It was thirty years ago. The Spanish director Gustavo CortÃƒÂ¨s Bueno was 30 years old. FrancoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dictatorship over Spain had lasted 40 years. The anniversary of General FrancoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death is the occasion to tackle the difficult task of looking back over the willingly forgotten History of FrancoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s years: the story of a collective amnesia.\n\nWhat is left of the dictatorship Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s in modern Spain ? For many it is still too early to talk about it: a sign that FrancoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ghost is still hovering above contemporary Spain. IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it high time to listen to those who lived through this period of Spanish history if we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want it to sink into oblivion?\n\nThe director, getting his own past back, is questioning the collective memory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6135a1dc7c28336c2987728811760217e03945c4","amp;dn":"When+Franco+died%2C+we+were+30+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6135a1dc7c28336c2987728811760217e03945c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,53,161,220,124,40,51,108,41,135,114,136,17,118,2,23,224,57,69,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
