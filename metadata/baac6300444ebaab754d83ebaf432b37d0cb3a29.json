But they're the same generals we know in name only: their appearance, personality, and gender are all different. One day, first Oda Nobunaga and then all the others are transported to our world. Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baac6300444ebaab754d83ebaf432b37d0cb3a29","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+21+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baac6300444ebaab754d83ebaf432b37d0cb3a29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,172,99,0,68,78,186,171,117,77,131,235,175,67,43,55,208,203,58,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
