Fed up, she enlists the help of her old friend, Tiny (Giddish), to help her figure out what to do with Dale after his latest double-cross. The girls brainstorm about what to do with the hapless Dale while they medicate themselves with only the best of prescriptions, Tennessee whiskey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which leads them to bigger problems. When Sheriff Cooley (Liotta) inconveniently enters the conundrum, the story evolves into a tale of revenge and survival that resolves in true Texas fashion: bold and ruthless. \n\nGenre: Thriller \nIMDB Rating: 2.5/10 \nDirected by: Jesse Baget \nStarring: Val Kilmer, Ray Liotta and Gina Gershon \n\nRelease Name: Breathless.2012.DVDRip.XviD-3LT0N \nSize: 700 MB \nVideo: XviD, 640Ãƒâ€”272, 940 kbps, 23.976fps \nAudio: English, MP3, 117 Kbps \nRuntime: 01:31:24\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e4bdf183413968a78459d0671f3d6fa19c36a28","amp;dn":"Breathless.2012.DVDRip.XviD-3LT0N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e4bdf183413968a78459d0671f3d6fa19c36a28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,75,223,24,52,19,150,138,120,69,157,6,113,243,214,250,25,195,106,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
