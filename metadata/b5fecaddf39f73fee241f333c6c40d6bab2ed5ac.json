The band's music was well known in the underground Christian scene at the time for its unique sound and optimistic lyrics. The name comes from &quot;Pax&quot; which is Latin for &quot;peace&quot; and the Bible verse Ephesians 2:17. The band's style consists of a mix of punk rock and rap with some reggae influences.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - August 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5fecaddf39f73fee241f333c6c40d6bab2ed5ac","amp;dn":"Pax217+Discography+2000-2004+%283+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5fecaddf39f73fee241f333c6c40d6bab2ed5ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,254,202,221,243,159,115,254,226,65,243,51,198,196,13,107,171,46,213,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
