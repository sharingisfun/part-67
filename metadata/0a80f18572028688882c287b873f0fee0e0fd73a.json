The player controls Regina, a member of the special forces team that is sent to investigate an isolated military facility that became infested with time-displaced dinosaurs as a result of a top-secret experiment. Because the enemies in the game are dinosaurs rather than undead creatures, Capcom promoted Dino Crisis as a &quot;survival panic&quot; in contrast to Resident Evil's survival horror label.\n\nInstallation instructions: just copy folder to ms0:\\PSPGame*\n\n* = Dino Crisis\n\nenjoy, seed and comment ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a80f18572028688882c287b873f0fee0e0fd73a","amp;dn":"Dino+Crisis+PSP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a80f18572028688882c287b873f0fee0e0fd73a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,128,241,133,114,2,134,136,136,44,40,123,135,63,15,238,14,15,215,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
