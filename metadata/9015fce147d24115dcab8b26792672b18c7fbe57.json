Dad is your regular 6'4&quot; pink rabbit who \nstays home while Mom works in a rainbow factory. Their \nkids are pretty standard too- there's Gumball, a blue cat \nwith a giant head, Anais, a 4-year-old genius bunny and \nDarwin, a pet goldfish who became part of the family when \nhe sprouted legs. At the heart of The Amazing World of \nGumball is Gumball, who faces the trials and tribulations \nof any 12-year-old-kid, like being chased by a rampaging \nT-Rex, or dressing as a cheerleader to impress the girl of\nhis dreams. The Amazing World of Gumball is the first UK\nproduced full length animation series out of Cartoon Net-\nwork Development Studio Europe. The series combines 2D and\n3D animation in a live-action setting.\n\n(This description was found on thefutoncritic.com)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9015fce147d24115dcab8b26792672b18c7fbe57","amp;dn":"Amazing.World.of.Gumball.S01E15b.The.Ape.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9015fce147d24115dcab8b26792672b18c7fbe57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,21,252,225,71,210,65,21,220,171,139,38,121,38,114,177,140,127,190,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
