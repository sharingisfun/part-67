You can also set a &quot;sleep time&quot; or &quot;on charge&quot; where the lights and/or sounds and vibrations will not be heard or seen.\n\nIt works on non-rooted phones and also allows the colors to flash in succession, so if you have a new SMS and a missed call it can alternate between the two colors. You can also set which notification type has the highest priority and let it flash in just that one color.\n\nThere's different profiles for when your phone is charging and when it is running on battery. If you find it eats your battery too much for your liking then you can change settings to conserve the battery use.\n\nWhat's in this version:\n3.1.1\nAdded t-mobile visual voicemail\nFix for s3 auto detection on some models\nFix for ePenPal\nForce close fixes\nFix for whatsapp when using popup notifications\nAdded\nScoreMobile FC\nCafÃƒÂ©\n\n\n\n\n                                  By bobiras2009\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d96bbe6d045a90de279944cdbaece09a3898775a","amp;dn":"Light+Flow+-+LED+Control+v3.1.1+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d96bbe6d045a90de279944cdbaece09a3898775a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,107,190,109,4,90,144,222,39,153,68,205,186,236,224,154,56,152,119,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
