It's a horror game unlike any other, and as you'll discover, its truths are entirely subjective.\n\nHome is a unique horror adventure set in a beautifully-realized pixel world. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a murder mystery with a twistÃ¢â‚¬â€because you decide what ultimately happens.&quot; \n\nTo play the game, just run the exe, no installation required.\n\nEnjoy! If you like it, buy it!
