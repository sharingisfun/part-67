Critics and naysayers dismissed the project as a watered-down Postal Service ripoff way too late in the game, but millions and millions of fans dismissed the critics and made the song an international chart-topper. While &quot;Fireflies&quot; was a really rare accidental Top 40 hit recorded by Young in his basement, The Midsummer Station is the most transparent bid for mainstream airplay imaginable, with each of its 11 tracks so tailored for pop radio, teen movie soundtracks, and soft drink commercials it's laughable. That's no dig on the quality of the album, just a statement of fact. Owl City has never shied away from big-sounding pop with emo underpinnings, and The Midsummer Station goes as big as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aad2689c9ea30df7464c899c60efd1b7cd5154f2","amp;dn":"Owl+City+-+The+Midsummer+Station+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aad2689c9ea30df7464c899c60efd1b7cd5154f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,210,104,156,158,163,13,247,70,76,137,156,96,239,209,183,205,81,84,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
