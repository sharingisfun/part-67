No dessert? No way! Everything in moderation, says Rachael Ray. After all, some days only chocolate or spaghetti will hit the spot.\nIn Rachael RayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 30-Minute Get Real Meals, the bestselling cookbook author and Food Network star serves up another helping of creative, hassle-free recipes that are ready to rock your tastebuds in less than thirty minutes. The latest addition to RachaelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s runaway hit series of 30-Minute Meals cookbooks is designed for cooks who want to look and feel great but long for the fun and the flavor thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s missing from their extreme low-carb meals.\n\nWhy fill your shopping cart and your stomach with processed, low-carb cereals and breads that taste like cardboard when you can eat the foods you crave? Here, at last, are recipes for those who just cannot and will not live totally carb-free: Pasta dinners made mostly with proteins and vegetables and only a couple of ounces of pasta per servings, fresh Thai and Mexican lettuce wraps, take-out-style stir-frys, and tons of burger ideasÃ¢â‚¬â€with and without the buns. And when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just got to satisfy that sweet tooth, even nonbakers (like Rachael) will flip for Nutty Creamsicle Pie, Stuffed Roasted Strawberries, and other surprisingly easy dessert recipes.\n\nWith more than 150 new dishes, plenty of time-saving tips, and a generous serving of Rachael's Ã¢â‚¬Å“you can do itÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ attitude, 30-Minute Get Real Meals proves you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to go to extremes to eat healthy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:906fc2fc62da584c0c4e210f8d4ac3d975d66ac9","amp;dn":"Eat+Healthy+Without+Going+to+Extremes+By+Rachael+Ray.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"906fc2fc62da584c0c4e210f8d4ac3d975d66ac9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,111,194,252,98,218,88,76,12,78,33,15,141,74,195,217,117,214,106,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
