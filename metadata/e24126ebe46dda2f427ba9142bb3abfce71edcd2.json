This book seeks to answer questions like, Why don't hipsters want to be called hipsters? and Why do they act like they are different when they are just like all the other hipsters?  If you can't stand hipsters, are a hipster, or don't know what a hipster is, this book is for you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e24126ebe46dda2f427ba9142bb3abfce71edcd2","amp;dn":"The+Sacred+%26amp%3B+the+Profane+an+Investigation+of+Hipsters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e24126ebe46dda2f427ba9142bb3abfce71edcd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,65,38,235,228,109,218,47,66,123,169,20,43,179,171,252,231,30,220,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
