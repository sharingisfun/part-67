As a theatre presentation, this compares to the Hollywood version with Jose Ferrer as well as any that portrays the realism of on-stage acting can do (much better at times).  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen both the 1950 version on the big screen, and this from 1974, and I believe the extemporaneous reactions found in live theatre are superior in many ways.  Peter Donat had done many other fine portrayals on TV, with 106 acting titles per IMDB. \nPeter is a nephew of actor Robert Donat, who was most notable as Mr. Chipping in Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939) with Greer Garson. \n\nTITLE............Cyrano de Bergerac\nYEAR.............1974\nGENRE............Drama / Action / Romance\nRUNTIME..........02:12:40\nIMDB URL......... http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0232194/ (for Peter Donat)\nAUDIO............98 Kbs (2 chnls) 16 kHz sampling rate\nVIDEO............1008 Kb/s WMV type 25.000 FPS\nLANGUAGE.........English\nRESOLUTION.......720 x 480\nFILES............1\nSIZE.............1.03 Gb \nSOURCE...........NTSC VHS tape\n\nN O T E S\nCAST.............Peter Donat, Marsha Mason, Marc Singer, and Kathryn Crosby\nDIRECTOR.........William Ball and Bruce Franchini\nCOUNTRY..........USA\nAUTHOR...........Edmond Rostand\nSTUDIO...........Thirteen WNET New York, filmed at The American Conservatory Theatre of San Francisco \n\nIn Edmond RostandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s swashbuckling yet bittersweet comedy, the characters experience emotions on a heroic scale.  The playÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hero, Cyrano,is a magnificent wit whose pride marks a deep insecurity about his appearance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ specifically, his abnormally large nose.  His compelling love for the beautiful heroine, Roxanne, is the motivating force behind all the action in the play.  With words from his own poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart, Cyrano wins Roxanne for another man, the tongue-tied but handsome Christian.\n\nU P L O A D E R S  F I N A L  N O T E S\n\nPlease seed!
