However, the ominous silence only concealed the deadly legacy of madness and, when a journalist named Carl Denning arrives to search for his missing lover, the malignant past and undying forces are brought back to the real world. From the second you enter the mansion, every moment is filled with horror. Three mysterious women are your only guides as you try to escape the haunted house.\n\nThe 11th Hour, the much-anticipated sequel to record-selling adventure horror The 7th Guest, follows the path of mystery, desolation, horror and grotesque logic set by its predecessor. It is one of the finest examples of blending cinematic sequences with a 3D environment. The 11th Hour, in a fashion similar to The 7th Guest, features 22 wonderfully pre-rendered 3D rooms that took almost three years to craft. This challenging interactive story offers a wide array of games, puzzles and quests wrought by the twisted mind of the legendary Henry Stauf. Will you unearth Old Man StaufÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate at last, or seal your own forever?\n\nAge requirements: ESRB Rating: MATURE with Suggestive Themes, Realistic Gore, Realistic Blood.\n\nMinimum system requirements: Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7, 1.8 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM (1 GB recommended), 3D graphics card (NVIDIA, ATI or newer Intel devices) compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended), 2GB HDD, Mouse, Keyboard.\nCompatibility notice: The game is incomatible with older Intel graphics devices.
