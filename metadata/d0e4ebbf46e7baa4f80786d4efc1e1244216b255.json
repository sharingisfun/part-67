While he sells death and decay for money to others he acts like he hasn't got no feelings at all. Thanks for his total cynism he hasn't got to absolve himself of his own responsibility because he doesn't even thinks he could be responsible. This movie is about one of his days, an extraordinary one when this anti-heroe puts the small pieces of life together and starts to understand the world and have feelings for people.\n\nAwards:\nBerlin International Film Festival -  Reader Jury of the &quot;Berliner Zeitung&quot;\nHungarian Film Critics Awards - LÃƒÂ¡szlÃƒÂ³ B.
