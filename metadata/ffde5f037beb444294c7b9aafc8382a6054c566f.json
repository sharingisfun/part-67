Soon the siblings hear some strange noises and the boy goes ahead to investigate, but the girl, worried about him, follows to a room where she finds the bodies of her parents hung up and dripping blood, to which she faints.\n\nYears later, a criminal breaks free from prison in Amestris, and the Elric brothers Edward and Alphonse join the effort to recapture him. The duo confronts the escapee who proves himself a dangerous opponent able to create ice and lightning from the alchemy circles drawn on the palm on his hands. Despite the Elrics' efforts to capture the criminal, he ends up escaping, and after some investigation with Edward's superior Roy Mustang and his assistant Riza Hawkeye, they learn that the fugitive, Melvin Voyager escaped despite him being weeks away from being released from jail. Among his belongings, they find a newspaper page with a part cut off, and comparing with an intact copy of the same page, they find that the missing piece is a photo of a young woman named Julia Crichton who was arrested while entering illegally in the remote Table City, set in the border between Amestris and Creta.\n\nIntrigued by the alchemy used by the criminal and his connection with Julia, the Elrics board a train to Table City to investigate further, but the train is attacked by an unknown individual who transforms into a wolf-chimera and takes control of the locomotive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffde5f037beb444294c7b9aafc8382a6054c566f","amp;dn":"%7BCX%7D+Fullmetal.Alchemist.The.Sacred.Star.Of.Milos.480p.HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffde5f037beb444294c7b9aafc8382a6054c566f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,222,95,3,123,235,68,66,148,199,185,170,252,131,130,166,5,76,86,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
