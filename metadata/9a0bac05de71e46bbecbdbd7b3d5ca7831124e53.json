Quite the premiere material, the third big\ndisc from this Portuguese, political genius, Vegan Straight\nEdge crew. Stylistically rooted in the tradition of old-\nschool melodic bands, but extending far beyond the\nstylistic conventions. Endearing music, endearing lyrics,\nand unique to this thing called 'the modern HC' is a 170-\npage book attached to the disc, with lyrics, band comments,\narticles, lots of information on political prisoners,\nuseful addresses... This makes the whole publishing unique\nand special.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://refuserecords.prv.pl/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://refuserecords.prv.pl/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTracks 1 and 6 are untitled on the album, so I went with\nwhat the grabber pulled off its online DB, which I thought\nmade sense. Track 16's title has a typo (&quot;Giulliani&quot;) on\nthe back cover; it's correctly written everywhere else.\nTrack 17's title is mentioned on the inside of the digipak\nand in the book that came with the CD.\n__________________________________________________\n\nncore releases &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/asianmofo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/asianmofo&lt;/a&gt; (38+) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kijyo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kijyo&lt;/a&gt; (1-37)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a0bac05de71e46bbecbdbd7b3d5ca7831124e53","amp;dn":"New_Winds-A_Spirit_Filled_Revolution-Digipak-2004-ncore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a0bac05de71e46bbecbdbd7b3d5ca7831124e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,11,172,5,222,113,228,107,190,203,219,215,179,213,202,120,49,18,78,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
