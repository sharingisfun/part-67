It is considered Lord's most adventurous concept album, largely instrumental and contemplative. It features performances from Sam Brown, Miller Anderson, Pete York and Thijs van Leer among others. Pictured Within was released in October 1998 by Virgin Classics. &quot;Wait A While&quot;, one of the few non-instrumental tracks off the album, performed by Sam Brown, was issued as a single in 1999. In addition, Jon Lord played a short tour of Germany in May 1999 to promote the album.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    Part 1 - The Valley\n\n    &quot;Sunrise&quot; (5.47)\n    &quot;Pictured Within&quot; (5.22) - Singer: Miller Anderson\n    &quot;From The Windmill&quot; (6.55)\n\n    Part 2 - Blue Sky Dreams\n\n    &quot;Circles Of Stone&quot; (2.24)\n    &quot;Menorca Blue&quot; (4.10)\n    &quot;Evening Song&quot; (8.00) - Singer: Sam Brown\n\n    Part 3 - Of Heroes and Heroines\n\n    &quot;Music For Miriam&quot; (4.48)\n    &quot;Arc-En-Ciel&quot; (4.29)\n    &quot;Wait A While&quot; (5.57) - Singer: Sam Brown\n\n    Part 4 - Beneath A Higher Heaven\n\n    &quot;Crystal Spa (Kyrie Eleison)&quot; (14.40)\n    &quot;The Mountain-Sunset&quot; (5.24)\n    &quot;A Different Sky&quot; (6.49)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Jon Lord - piano\n    Haagen Kuhr - cello\n    Ina Stock - oboe, cor Anglais\n    Frank Struck - French horn\n    Rodrigo Reichel - violin\n    Stefan Pintev - violin\n    Vytas Sondeckis - cello\n    Mike Routledge - viola\n    Miller Anderson - vocal\n    Sam Brown - vocal\n    Mario Argandona - percussion, voices\n    Pete York - orchestral percussion\n    Colin Hodgkinson - fretless bass\n    Ravi - kora\n    Thijs Van Leer - flute\n    Rick Keller - soprano saxophone\n    Sabine Van Baaren - voices\n    Christina Lux-York - voices\n    Serge Mailiard - voices\n    Stefan Scheuss - voices\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bd0ef90de05f325e4d02f96db907a2c57c22a1a","amp;dn":"Jon+Lord+-+Pictured+Within+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bd0ef90de05f325e4d02f96db907a2c57c22a1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,208,239,144,222,5,243,37,228,208,47,150,219,144,122,44,87,194,42,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
