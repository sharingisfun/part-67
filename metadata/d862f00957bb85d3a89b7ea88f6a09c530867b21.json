On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart.\n\nMeanwhile, the wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort...alive.\n\nHarry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale-the legend of the Deathly Hallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks.\n\nLittle does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became &quot;the Boy Who Lived.&quot; No longer just a boy, Harry Potter is drawing ever closer to the task for which he has been preparing since the day he first stepped into Hogwarts: the ultimate battle with Voldemort. \n---------------------------------------\nTechnical Details\n---------------------------------------\nDirector David Yates\nYear 2010\nScreen Widescreen 2.40:1 anamorphic\nLanguages English - Dolby Digital (5.1)\nAdditional Languages Italian\nSubtitles Danish English Finnish Icelandic Italian  Norwegian Swedish\nDuration 2 hours and 20 minutes (approx)\n---------------------------------------\nSpecial Features / Extras\n---------------------------------------\nÃ‚Â» Adittional scenes\nÃ‚Â» Behind the soundtrack\n---------------------------------------\nActors\n---------------------------------------\nDaniel Radcliffe, Ralph Fiennes, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy, Tom Felton, Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, John Hurt, Rhys Ifans, Bonnie Wright, Jason Isaacs, Brendan Gleeson &amp; Miranda Richardson\n---------------------------------------\nGenre\n---------------------------------------\nFantasy\n---------------------------------------\nLabel\n---------------------------------------\nHarry Potter And The Deathly Hallows - Part 1 [2010PAL][En.It Subs[Nordic.En.It.Is]\n---------------------------------------\nInformation pÃƒÂ¥ svenska \n---------------------------------------\n Orkar inte skriva...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d862f00957bb85d3a89b7ea88f6a09c530867b21","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+And+The+Deathly+Hallows+-+Part+1+%5B2010+PAL%5D%5BEn.It+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d862f00957bb85d3a89b7ea88f6a09c530867b21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,98,240,9,87,187,133,211,168,155,126,168,143,106,9,197,48,134,123,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
