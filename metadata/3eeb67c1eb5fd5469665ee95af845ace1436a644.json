'One of the most wonderful things about filming plants is that you can reveal hidden aspects of their lives,' said David Attenborough. 'You can capture the moment as one plant strangles another, and as they burst into flower. But whilst time-lapse photography allows you to see things that no human being has ever seen before.' Filmed over the course of a year at the Royal Botanic Gardens in West London, each of the three 50 minute episodes will cover a different area of plant life, from plant survival in wet and humid zones, scent and communication, and the continual adaptation of plants. This immersive and compelling series reveals a fascinating new look at plant life.\n\n\n\n\n4)  Making \nIn this series we set out to capture the true splendour of plants, in their own timescale, as they interact with animals, fungi and each other. And what is more, we wanted to film all of this at a microscopic level. Kingdom of plants 3D was to be a series with plants as the heroes, and we needed to do them justice. Our production team at Atlantic embarked upon an exciting technological adventure, developing our own specialist camera kit to shoot 3D in extreme close-up. At Kew the loading bay of the tropical nursery was transformed into a bespoke macro studio, we developed new ways of filming 3D time-lapse, and we built whole new rigs to capture the tiniest details of plant and animal structures. All of this took meticulous planning and a herculean effort in logistics alone, but the hard work has been rewarded.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/6607/kingdomofplantsscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/6607/kingdomofplantsscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/2204/kingdomofplantsscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/2204/kingdomofplantsscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/1585/kingdomofplantsscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/1585/kingdomofplantsscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/6872/kingdomofplantsscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/6872/kingdomofplantsscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img502.imageshack.us/img502/6253/kingdomofplantsscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img502.imageshack.us/img502/6253/kingdomofplantsscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/9214/kingdomofplantsscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/9214/kingdomofplantsscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img821.imageshack.us/img821/9523/kingdomofplantsscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img821.imageshack.us/img821/9523/kingdomofplantsscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/1863/kingdomofplantsscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/1863/kingdomofplantsscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/5971/kingdomofplantsscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/5971/kingdomofplantsscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1872 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 464\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 50.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 745 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2012/may/25/david-attenborough-kingdom-plants-kew&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2012/may/25/david-attenborough-kingdom-plants-kew&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kingdomofplants.com/?page_id=8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kingdomofplants.com/?page_id=8&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eeb67c1eb5fd5469665ee95af845ace1436a644","amp;dn":"BSkyB+Kingdom+of+Plants+4of4+Making+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eeb67c1eb5fd5469665ee95af845ace1436a644","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,235,103,193,235,95,213,70,150,101,238,149,175,132,90,206,20,54,166,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
