The sun has scorched the earth, and now dense clouds hang above overpopulated megacities. Those whose DNA is considered unworthy are locked out of the cities and forced to wander the wastelands. It's Michelle's duty to ensure that no undesirables gain entry into the city, and she earns a substantial paycheck for doing so. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi\n\nTheatrical Feature Running Time:\n    96 mins \n\nDirector(s):\n    Pearry Reginald Teo\n\nWriter(s):\n    Keith Collea, Zhang Ping Li\n\nProducer(s):\n    Keith Collea\n\nTheatrical MPAA Rating:\n    R\n\nCategories:\n    Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8be874940429bedcff89da90a356ca13dba736ba","amp;dn":"The+Gene+Generation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8be874940429bedcff89da90a356ca13dba736ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,232,116,148,4,41,190,220,255,137,218,144,163,86,202,19,219,167,54,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
