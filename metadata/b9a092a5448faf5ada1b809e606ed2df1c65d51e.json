There is truth here for all ages and beliefs. If Darwin was wrong...........then the Schools have been intentionally lying to our Children. If the schools teach Darwinism which says there is NO CHRIST. Then they are of The Anti-Christ. Public Schools teaching books CHANGE EVERY YEAR. The Bible never changes. So where is truth??? In Evolution Theories??? If you believe in Evolution you are denying The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit of the Praise They are entitled too for making everything you understand and can see and more than that, everything you don't understand and can't see. If you have never thanked the CREATOR for his Creation now is your chance to thank Him.\n\nDescription\nVideos by DR. CHARLES JACKSON:\n\nDeath of Darwinism This Year:\nThis is a quick, solid, overall summary of the current situation in the creation-evolution controversy. This is the one DVD to watch over and over. You'll learn something new every time you do.\n\n\n\nThis is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9a092a5448faf5ada1b809e606ed2df1c65d51e","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Creation+-+38+-+The+Death+of+Darwinism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9a092a5448faf5ada1b809e606ed2df1c65d51e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,160,146,165,68,143,175,90,218,27,128,158,96,110,210,223,28,101,213,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
