Deep red when it's smoldering hot, icy white when it's freezing. Multiple background patterns are included (and a lot more are coming soon!), like retro baroque wallpapers, funky flowers and shiny metal. Summer, winter, autumn or spring: the weather decides the color of your phone. Very customizable, very fun.\n\n\n                                   By bobiras2009\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47034f3924d6a57e43a958a194a6129115f3183d","amp;dn":"How+Cold+Is+It%3F+v1.7+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47034f3924d6a57e43a958a194a6129115f3183d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,3,79,57,36,214,165,126,67,169,88,161,148,166,18,145,21,243,24,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
