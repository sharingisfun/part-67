In the winter of 2006, a strange phenomenon fell upon honeybee hives across the country. Without a trace, millions of bees vanished from their hives, leaving billions of dollars of crops at risk and potentially threatening our food supply. The epidemic set researchers scrambling to discover why honeybees were dying in record numbers Ã¢â‚¬â€ and to stop the epidemic in its tracks before it spread further.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d040b012af9a8d32faeb162e90e4b011152f10","amp;dn":"PBS+Nature-Silence+of+the+Bees.Barbanegra.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d040b012af9a8d32faeb162e90e4b011152f10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,208,64,176,18,175,154,141,50,250,235,22,46,144,228,176,17,21,47,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
