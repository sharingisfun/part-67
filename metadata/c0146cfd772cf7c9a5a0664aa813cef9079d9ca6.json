Unlike other contact widgets, it learns your most important LOCATIONS and displays the contacts you usually prefer to call in those places (for example, business contacts at the office and friends/family at home).\n\nNo configuring, no settings, no GPS needed. The application automatically adapts to your individual ways of use, to provide the ultimate user experience.\n\nHow does it work?\nAfter installation, simply add the Call AI widget to the home screen and you're done. Algorithms begin their work immediately, and within the next few days it will learn.\n\nJust keep an eye on the widget, as contacts and background graphic become automatically adapted to your individual use pattern and current location.\n\nWhat's in this version: (Updated : Sep 4, 2012)\n\n    Added support for more screen layouts: 4x1, 4x2, 2x2\n    Updated usage of Google licensing system, should prevent faulty &quot;No license&quot; text after installation\n    Welcome screen UI overhaul; instructions for adding the widget; removed unnecessary permissions\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.0+\n\n\n                                   By bobiras2009\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0146cfd772cf7c9a5a0664aa813cef9079d9ca6","amp;dn":"Call+AI+v1.0.3+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0146cfd772cf7c9a5a0664aa813cef9079d9ca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,20,108,253,119,44,247,201,165,160,102,74,168,19,206,249,7,157,156,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
