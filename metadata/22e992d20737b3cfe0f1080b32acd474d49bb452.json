And the Clocks Moved\n2. Cruel\n3. Run\n4. To Know You\n\n\n\nReview from Orlando Weekly:\n\nOrlando singer Ashley Dudukovich is many things on her band Chasing Jonah's debut EP: heart-shattered, afraid of love and &quot;walking down Mills Avenue&quot; after some car trouble, &quot;where early sunset leapt off and took flight.&quot; One thing she's not is a dummy. Although her front-and-center, delicately lilting voice rises and falls with seemingly every painful memory a lyric digs up Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an undeniably voyeuristic pleasure Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chasing Jonah's tracks start slow, build to crescendos capably managed by her backing band and only realize their fullness at the peak pop moment, making this effort a demo sure to perk up the ears of the lovesick and licensing scouts alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22e992d20737b3cfe0f1080b32acd474d49bb452","amp;dn":"Chasing+Jonah+-+Debut+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22e992d20737b3cfe0f1080b32acd474d49bb452","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,233,146,210,7,55,179,207,224,241,8,11,50,172,212,116,212,155,180,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
