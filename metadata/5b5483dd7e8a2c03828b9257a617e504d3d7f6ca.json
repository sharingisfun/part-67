Captured alive, Breivik was more than willing to explain his actions as a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnecessary atrocityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ designed to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœwake upÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Europe to its betrayal by the left, and its impending destruction through immigration.\n\nBreivikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beliefs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ expressed at length in a manifesto, 2083 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ were part of a huge volume of right-wing alarmism and xenophobia that had arisen in the last decade. Yet Breivik, we were told by the Right, was simply a madman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so mad, in fact, that he had actually believed what the Right said: that Europe was in imminent danger of destruction, and extreme action was required.\n\nOn UtÃƒÂ¸ya: Anders Breivik, Right Terror, Racism and Europe is a response to this attempt to deny responsibility, and any connection of BreivikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s act to a rising cult of violence, racism, and apocalyptic language. The editors and authors shine a light on BreivikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions, and argue that they cannot be understood abstracted from the far-Right racist and Islamophobic social and political conditions in which it emerged.\n\nOrganised, written and produced within three months of the killings, On UtÃƒÂ¸ya is a challenge to anyone who would seek to portray this event as anything other than it is Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a violent mass assassination, directed against the left, to terrorise people into silence and submission to a far-right agenda. It concludes with an examination of the manufacture of hate and fear in Australia, and considers what is needed in a Left strategy to deal with the growing threat of far-Right organising.\n\nEdited by Elizabeth Humphrys, Guy Rundle and Tad Tietze, with essays by Anindya Bhattacharyya, Antony Loewenstein, Lizzie O'Shea, Richard Seymour, Jeff Sparrow and the editors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b5483dd7e8a2c03828b9257a617e504d3d7f6ca","amp;dn":"On+Utoya%3A+Anders+Breivik%2C+Right+Terror%2C+Racism+and+Europe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b5483dd7e8a2c03828b9257a617e504d3d7f6ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,84,131,221,126,138,44,3,130,139,146,87,166,23,229,4,211,215,246,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
