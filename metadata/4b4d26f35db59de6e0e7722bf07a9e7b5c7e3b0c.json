They even cover &quot;People Get Ready&quot; just like the Fudge...\nThere music was of the heavy Vanilla Fudge variety, and not apparently memorable. Playing mostly originals, but also a few standards, opening up with Hendrix &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; among others. A nice guitar driven platter from the 60's\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b4d26f35db59de6e0e7722bf07a9e7b5c7e3b0c","amp;dn":"Group+Therapy+-+People+Get+Ready+%281968%29+LP+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b4d26f35db59de6e0e7722bf07a9e7b5c7e3b0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,77,38,243,93,181,157,230,224,231,114,43,240,122,158,123,92,126,59,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
