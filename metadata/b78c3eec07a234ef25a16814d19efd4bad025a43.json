Dotto Tech airs 7 days a week, 8 times a week from coast to coast, and is seen annually by 17 million people. Each set contains 26 episodes on six DVDs, and covers a wide range of topics. Topics include:\n- PC cleaning &amp; upgrading\n- Halloween crafts\n- Small business publishing\n- Wireless media\n- Waste reduction &amp; recycling\n- Home video production &amp; editing\n- Tax prep ... and much more!\n\nIn this Episode #1-5 we will have a look at:\n- Episode 1 Back to School -\nWindows XP and general PC maintenance\nEpson MFP\nMicrosoft Encarta 2005\nThe hilight of this episode,  showing how to clean CRT monitors, and looking at Microsoft Encarta 2005, I think it came on 8 or 9 CDs!\n\nTo launch our 3rd season at CITY TV I concentrated on the education market.\nWe start out with a bit on maintenance, using system updates. This show has a Windows focus, and I am showing all this in Wiondows XP. We look at updates, system packs and updating applications.\nThen I rolled up my sleeves and talked about physical cleaning and maintenance, I actually show cleaning CRT monitors, I had forgotten about those! This segment is actually still really relevant!\nFor students I take a look at the old Epson CX line of MFPs. remember back in those days people often had separate scanners, and printers, remember that?\nMicrosoft made a huge investment back in the day in Encarta, This was before the Web became the resource it is today.\nI smiled as I watched this demo, as so much of what we were showing on Encarta is a harbinger of the type of content we value online\n\n- Episode 2 Small Business Publishing -\nIn this episode I take a pass at small business solutions.Starting with a demo of Microsoft Office 2003, yep thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right, 2003! Do you remember living in Office? The scary thing is for many people, this is still current. It is interesting that the techniques I show in this episode are still relevant today!\nI move on to a  small publishing project creating a brochure using Microsoft Publisher. You know, even in 2005 I was not really all that down with Publisher, but I think we made it look pretty good, and other options were near as cumbersome. We print the project  looking at the HP9130 Multifunction Printer. A great old Inkjet workhorse.\nThe last part of the show is the best, I spend some time showing how to use that new fangled resource.....Google.....yep, Google. It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the omnipresent force that it is today. I even throw a bone to AltaVista!\n\n- Episode 3 Apple Moving Day -\nSwitching from Windows to Mac.\n\n- Episode 4 Waste Reduction &amp; Recycling -\n\n- Episode 5 Halloween Crafts -\n\nINFO:\nResolution- 720x480\nFrame Rate- 29.97fps\nPixel Shape- 10:11(NTSC 4:3)\nVideo Structure- Progressive\nSize: 1.09 GB\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b78c3eec07a234ef25a16814d19efd4bad025a43","amp;dn":"Dotto+Tech-+Season+3%28Shows+1-5%29%7Bdvdmp4%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b78c3eec07a234ef25a16814d19efd4bad025a43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,140,62,236,7,162,52,239,37,161,104,20,209,158,253,75,173,2,90,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
