The intent is to unify, energize, and embolden secular people nationwide, while dispelling the negative opinions held by so much of American society... and have a good time doing it!\n\nAcross America, in every city, every town, and every school, secularism is on the rise. Whether people call themselves atheists, agnostics, secular Humanists, or any of the other terms used to describe their god-free lifestyle, secularism is coming out of the closet.\n\nOn March 24, 2012, from 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM at the National Mall, nontheists from all corners of the globe descended on Washington, D.C. en masse to deliver the good news: &quot;We're huge, we're everywhere, and we're growing.&quot;\n-----\n\n\nVideo listing:\n \t1-01 \tBeginning of Show\n \t1-02 \tAndy Shernoff\n \t1-03 \tRonelle Adams\n \t1-04 \tShelley Segal\n \t1-05 \tJason Torpy\n \t1-06 \tPaul Provenza\n \t1-07 \tDavid Silverman\n \t1-08 \tHemant Mehta\n \t1-09 \tJessica Ahlquist\n \t1-10 \tJesse Galef\n \t1-11 \tAdam Savage\n \t1-12 \tGreta Christina\n \t1-13 \tTaslima Nasrin\n \t2-01 \tDavid Silverman\n \t2-02 \tPenn Jillette\n \t2-03 \tFred Edwords\n \t2-04 \tJamie Kilstein\n \t2-05 \tJamila Bey\n \t2-06 \tMichael Shermer\n \t2-07 \tJames Randi\n \t2-08 \tBill Maher\n \t2-09 \tIndra Zuno\n \t2-10 \tAnnie Gaylor\n \t2-11 \tVictor Harris\n \t2-12 \tHitchens Tribute\n \t3-01 \tNate Phelps\n \t3-02 \tSean Faircloth\n \t3-03 \tElizabeth Cornwell\n \t3-04 \tRichard Dawkins\n \t3-05 \tChristina Rad\n \t3-06 \tRational Warrior\n \t3-07 \tHerb Silverman\n \t3-08 \tPete Stark\n \t3-09 \tTom Harkin\n \t3-10 \tPZ Myers\n \t3-11 \tRon Lindsay\n \t3-12 \tLawrence Krauss\n \t3-13 \tRoy Speckhardt\n \t4-01 \tTodd Steifel\n \t4-02 \tPhoto Montage\n \t4-03 \tClosing Credits and Thanks\n \t4-04 \tBonus Track\n\n\n\nPlease note that the performances by Tim Minchin, Eddie Izzard, and Bad Religion were not included in on the DVD (presumably for contractual reasons, unknown at time of writing) and thus are not included here.

Try these!\n\tOn a Computer: Use VLC or MPlayer (any operating system)\n\n\tOn an Android: The VLC Beta is perfect!\n\t\tIf you can't find it on the app store (eg, North American users), try these:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://nightlies.videolan.org/build/android-v7-neon/VLC-debug.apk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://nightlies.videolan.org/build/android-v7-neon/VLC-debug.apk&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://nightlies.videolan.org/build/android-v7-tegra2/VLC-debug.apk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://nightlies.videolan.org/build/android-v7-tegra2/VLC-debug.apk&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\t\tAs an alternate, MX Player works fine, but you may have to play with the software decoding options in the upper-right. For my device, I just needed to set Audio Track #1 (S/W) and it worked fine.\n\n\tOn an iPhone: Mac users suggest GoodPlayer or AVPlayerHD.\n\n\nIf you liked this please consider buying the DVD! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://reasonrally.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://reasonrally.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34951f18f4466a736e32dd24d86fc7603f75937c","amp;dn":"Reason+Rally+2012+Full+DVD+Footage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34951f18f4466a736e32dd24d86fc7603f75937c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,149,31,24,244,70,106,115,110,50,221,36,216,111,199,96,63,117,147,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
