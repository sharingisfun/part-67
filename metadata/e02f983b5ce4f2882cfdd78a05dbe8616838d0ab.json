But they're the same generals we know in name only: their appearance, personality, and gender are all different. One day, first Oda Nobunaga and then all the others are transported to our world. Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e02f983b5ce4f2882cfdd78a05dbe8616838d0ab","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+23+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e02f983b5ce4f2882cfdd78a05dbe8616838d0ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,47,152,59,92,228,242,136,44,253,215,138,5,219,232,97,104,56,208,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
