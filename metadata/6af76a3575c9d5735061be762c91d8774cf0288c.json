As usual, Ella uplifts all of the material and her best moments come on &quot;Somebody Loves Me,&quot; a heartfelt &quot;Moonlight Becomes You,&quot; a scat-filled &quot;Blue Skies&quot; and (somewhat surprisingly) &quot;St. Louis Blues.&quot; Although this was not her most essential release, the formerly obscure Get Happy finds Ella Fitzgerald at the peak of her powers. \n\n01.
