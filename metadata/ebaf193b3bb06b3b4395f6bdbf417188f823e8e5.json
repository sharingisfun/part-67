To see the installation instructions and to get an ISO, please go to this page.\n\nI would like to thank all the developers who have worked on this project. Creating Qubes OS has been a great challenge, especially for such a small team as ours, but ultimately, I'm very glad with the final outcome Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it really is a stable and reasonably secure desktop OS. In fact I cannot think of any more secure alternative...\n\nI use the term Ã¢â‚¬Å“reasonably secureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, because when it comes to defensive security it's difficult to use definite statements (Ã¢â‚¬Å“secureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“unbreakableÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, etc), unless one can formally prove the whole design and implementation to be 100% secure.\n\nListeen more\n\nFree Pussy Riot!\n\nFuck the putin pidoras and gnida!\n\nFuck the suka gundiay!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebaf193b3bb06b3b4395f6bdbf417188f823e8e5","amp;dn":"iso_Qubes-R1-x86_64-DVD.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebaf193b3bb06b3b4395f6bdbf417188f823e8e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,175,25,59,59,176,107,59,67,149,246,189,191,65,113,136,248,35,232,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
