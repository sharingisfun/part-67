A satiric amalgam of glam rock and 1950s horror movies, The Rocky Horror Show was a minor sensation on the fringes of London musical theater in 1973. Veteran record executive and producer Lou Adler brought the show's star, Tim Curry, to L.A. and built a production around him; Adler also produced a cast album using the cream of the L.A. session scene. In these musicians' hands, the music became much slicker and more mainstream. Nevertheless, the recording was a far more professional effort than its British predecessor. The Rocky Horror Show ran for nine months in Los Angeles, after which a film version, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, was shot. Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon proved to be the best Brad and Janet ever; the original cast members, especially Curry, reveled in the opportunity to immortalize their portrayals; and Rocky Horror's potential as a witty parody of cheap movies, rock &amp; roll, and sexual mores was fully realized. The songs &quot;Planet Shmanet Janet&quot; and &quot;The Sword of Damocles&quot; were heard in the film but left off the soundtrack; those tracks, plus Bostwick's deleted performance of &quot;Once in a While,&quot; have been included on the Rocky Horror International disc, along with songs from the original London cast album and performances by casts from Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, and Australia. The Songs from the Vaults disc is a mixed bag that will appeal to completists.\n\n01 Various - The Rocky Horror Picture Show Movie Trailer\n02 Tim Curry - Baby Love\n03 Richard O'Brien - Rocky Horror Radio Commercial\n04 Little Nell - See You 'Round Like A Record\n05 Various - Rocky Horror Radio Commercial (Belt You About The Mouth)\n06 Tim Curry - Just 14\n07 Shock Treatment Cast - Denton U.S.A.\n08 Little Nell - Do The Swim\n09 Tim Curry - Biting My Nails\n10 Richard O'Brien - Shock Treatment\n11 Little Nell - Fever\n12 Tim Curry - We Went As Far As We Felt Like Going\n13 Shock Treatment Cast - Little Black Dress\n14 Little Nell - Beauty Queen\n15 The Laker Band - The Time Warp\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfdfe922843087435539669c4f4defa2230ebd5c","amp;dn":"Songs+From+The+Vaults+-+A+Collection+of+Rocky+Horror+Rarities+%281","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfdfe922843087435539669c4f4defa2230ebd5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,223,233,34,132,48,135,67,85,57,102,156,79,77,239,162,35,14,189,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
