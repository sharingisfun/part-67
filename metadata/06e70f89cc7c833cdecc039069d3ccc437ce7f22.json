Notably (at least some\nversions of) VLC doesn't detect the audio track well at all.\nMedia Player Classic has no problem whatsoever.\nThe practical says - convert the audio to MP3, since AVI\ndoesn't do AAC well. But then I'd have to create a moniker\nand take credit for actually doing something here.\nBut MP3 is somewhat standard for AVI, so why not?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06e70f89cc7c833cdecc039069d3ccc437ce7f22","amp;dn":"Damages.S05E01.AHDTV.x264.MP3-MOMENTUM.avi+%28MP3+audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06e70f89cc7c833cdecc039069d3ccc437ce7f22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,231,15,137,204,124,131,60,222,204,3,144,105,211,204,196,55,206,127,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
