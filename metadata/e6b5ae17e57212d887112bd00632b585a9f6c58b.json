Beauty and Beast star in their own mid-century modern detective story set in the smoky clubs and dive bars of 1940s Los Angeles. This stand-alone issue from the guest team of writer Matthew Sturges and Shawn McManus is set in the heyday of Hollywood, where ancient Greek evil shows us that 'Everything beautiful leads to ruin in the end.'\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6b5ae17e57212d887112bd00632b585a9f6c58b","amp;dn":"Fairest+07+%282012%29+%28c2c+%26amp%3B+noAds%29+%28theProletariat-DCP%29+%5BDCP-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6b5ae17e57212d887112bd00632b585a9f6c58b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,181,174,23,229,114,18,216,135,17,43,208,6,50,181,133,169,246,197,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
