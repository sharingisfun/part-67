Easy to understand and filled with lively real-world examples, ECONOMICS: A CONTEMPORARY INTRODUCTION, Ninth Edition, is your ideal introduction to the principles of economics. McEachern approaches the course by using many economic concepts that you've likely encountered in your own life experiences. These life experiences are then explained as economic concepts through interesting case studies and focused examples. The case studies are found throughout the text, giving you genuine insight into how economic principles work in the real world -- and the recent economic crisis is covered throughout. McEachern's approachable style is enhanced by the powerful learning tools you'll find on Aplia, a web-based educational program designed to improve your understanding and your grade.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64379c7353697bae8b80cd9a30b7e02ca2fc6d35","amp;dn":"Economics-+A+Contemporary+Introduction+9ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64379c7353697bae8b80cd9a30b7e02ca2fc6d35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,55,156,115,83,105,123,174,139,128,205,154,48,183,224,44,162,252,109,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
