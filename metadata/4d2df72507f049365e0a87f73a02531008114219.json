In between dead-on impersonations of Truman Capote, Katherine Hepburn, Tennessee Williams, Clark Gable, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, John Quincy Adams and Frederico Fellini, Gore left us with some memorable quotes on some memorable topics. The subject at-hand was the release of a new book of photographs GORE VIDAL: Snapshots in History's Glare.\n\nThis book is Gore Vidal's visual memoir of his remarkable and famously well-lived life. In this collection of photographs, letters, manuscripts, and other selections from Vidal's vast personal archives, readers are now escorted by one of America's wittiest insiders into the Kennedys' Camelot, as well as onto the set of Ben Hur, and into the private lives of Eleanor Roosevelt, Paul Newman, and Tennessee Williams, to name just a few.\n\nBorn into public life, here Vidal looks back on his days as an Army officer in WWII, his rise as a groundbreaking and controversial novelist, his years in Hollywood, his forays into the political arena, and his notoriously public triumphs and feuds. Written with Vidal's legendary wit and literary elegance, this book reveals not only the personal reflections of one of the last of the great generation of American writers, but also a captivating social history of the 20th century told by one of our great raconteurs.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/92Y-Gore-Vidal-October-20-2009/dp/B0037QGUQW&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/92Y-Gore-Vidal-October-20-2009/dp/B0037QGUQW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://blog.92y.org/index.php/weblog/item/gore_vidal_recap/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://blog.92y.org/index.php/weblog/item/gore_vidal_recap/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRip specs:\n      Format : AVI\n      File size : 765 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 19mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 341 Kbps\n      Writing application : MEncoder SVN-r31187-4.4.1\n   Video #0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Advanced Simple@L1\n      Codec ID : DX50\n      Codec ID/Hint : DivX 5\n      Duration : 1h 19mn\n      Bit rate : 1 200 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Bit depth : 8 bits\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.130\n      Writing library : Lavc52.68.3\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Mode : Joint stereo\n      Mode extension : MS Stereo\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d2df72507f049365e0a87f73a02531008114219","amp;dn":"92Y+GORE+VIDAL+October+20%2C+2009+Snapsots+In+Historys+Glare+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d2df72507f049365e0a87f73a02531008114219","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,45,247,37,7,240,73,54,94,10,135,247,58,2,83,16,8,17,66,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
