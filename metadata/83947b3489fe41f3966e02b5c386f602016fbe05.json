Jaeger\n\n   This introductory book assumes minimal knowledge of the existence of integrated circuits and of the terminal behavior of electronic components such as resistors, diodes, and MOS and bipolar transistors. It presents to readers the basic information necessary for more advanced processing and design books. Focuses mainly on the basic processes used in fabrication, including lithography, oxidation, diffusion, ion implementation, and thin film deposition. Covers interconnection technology, packaging, and yield. Appropriate for readers interested in the area of fabrication of solid state devices and integrated circuits.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83947b3489fe41f3966e02b5c386f602016fbe05","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Microelectronic+Fabrication+-+2+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83947b3489fe41f3966e02b5c386f602016fbe05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,148,123,52,137,254,65,243,150,110,2,181,195,134,246,2,1,111,190,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
