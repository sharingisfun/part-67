Backed by little more than simple guitar accompaniment, the Hummingbirds evoke the clarity and purity of a cappella, but their harmonies also boast an elasticity unmistakably rooted in street-corner doo wop; alter the subject matter from Jesus to the pretty girl next door, and Christian Testimonial would fit comfortably alongside the best of the Drifters or the Clovers.~Jason Ankeny (Allmusic)\n\n01.
